**TASK: Extract all medical entities, attributes, and relationships from clinical text**

You are an expert clinical data extractor. Extract ALL relevant medical information from the provided clinical trial eligibility criteria text.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (Pure JSON):**
{{
  "entities": [
    {{
      "text": "exact text mention",
      "type": "entity type (condition, biomarker, genomic_variant, medication, procedure, demographic, etc.)",
      "attributes": {{
        "status": "positive/negative/equivocal if applicable",
        "value": "numerical value or description if available",
        "unit": "unit of measurement if applicable",
        "temporal_context": "past/current/future if applicable"
      }},
      "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
      "source_context": {{
        "section": "document section where found",
        "position": "approximate character position",
        "context_sentence": "full sentence containing the entity"
      }}
    }}
  ],

      "source_entity_index": 0,
      "target_entity_index": 1,
      "relationship_type": "has_status, has_value, indicates, contraindicates, etc.",
      "confidence": 0.0-1.0
    }}
  ],
  "metadata": {{
    "extraction_method": "llm_based",
    "text_length": 123,

  }}
}}

**ENTITY TYPES TO EXTRACT:**
- condition: Diseases, disorders, cancer types, syndromes
- biomarker: Laboratory markers, protein expressions, receptor status
- genomic_variant: Genetic mutations, variants, amplifications, deletions
- medication: Drugs, pharmaceuticals, treatments
- procedure: Surgical procedures, interventions, tests
- demographic: Age, gender, race, ethnicity, performance status
- temporal: Time-related constraints (e.g., "within 6 months")
- exclusion: Exclusion criteria, contraindications

**EXTRACTION RULES:**
1. Extract EVERY medical entity mentioned, regardless of cancer type
2. Capture both positive and negative findings (e.g., "ER negative", "no BRCA mutations")
3. Include numerical values and units when available (e.g., ">50%", "2.5 cm")
4. Preserve the exact text mention for source tracking
5. Assign appropriate confidence scores based on clarity of mention
6. Capture relationships between entities when evident
7. Include source context for provenance tracking

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Extract ALL medical entities, not just cancer-specific ones
2. Preserve exact text mentions for source provenance
3. Include confidence scores based on clarity of mention
4. Capture relationships between entities when evident
5. Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text
6. If no entities found, return empty arrays but never skip the JSON structure

**CLINICAL TEXT TO PROCESS:**
{clinical_text}
