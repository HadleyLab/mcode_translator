You are an expert clinical data analyst specializing in mCODE (minimal Common Oncology Data Elements) extraction from clinical trial documents. Your task is to identify and map mCODE-relevant information from clinical trial protocols and descriptions.

Clinical Text:
```
{clinical_text}
```

## EXTRACTION RULES:

### 1. CLINICAL TRIAL CONTEXT
- Clinical trials contain structured information in eligibility criteria, descriptions, interventions, and outcomes
- Map information from all sections: eligibility, interventions, descriptions, conditions, etc.
- Consider both inclusion/exclusion criteria and actual patient characteristics

### 2. EVIDENCE-BASED MAPPING
- Extract information that is explicitly stated or clearly implied in the trial context
- Use clinical trial terminology and medical concepts appropriately
- Map cancer conditions, treatments, biomarkers, and patient characteristics

### 3. CONFIDENCE SCORING
- 1.0: Direct statement (e.g., "Stage IV breast cancer", "HER2 positive")
- 0.8: Clear clinical terminology (e.g., "metastatic breast cancer", "chemotherapy")
- 0.6: Standard medical inference (e.g., "breast cancer patients" implies female gender)
- 0.4: Reasonable interpretation from context
- 0.2: Weak inference requiring significant interpretation

### 4. TEXT FRAGMENT EXTRACTION
- Provide relevant text snippets (20-100 words) that support the mapping
- Include context from eligibility criteria, interventions, or descriptions
- Focus on the most relevant supporting text

### 5. CONSERVATIVE APPROACH
- Better to miss mappings than create incorrect ones
- Focus on core cancer-related elements
- Avoid redundant mappings

## REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (Pure JSON - Return ONLY valid JSON):

```json
{{
  "mcode_mappings": [
    {{
      "element_type": "CancerCondition|CancerTreatment|TNMStage|etc",
      "code": "SNOMED_CODE or appropriate code",
      "display": "Human readable name",
      "system": "http://snomed.info/sct or appropriate system",
      "confidence_score": 0.0,
      "evidence_text": "Supporting text from clinical trial"
    }}
  ],
  "metadata": {{
    "extraction_method": "clinical_trial_llm",
    "text_length": 123,
    "resource_count": 10
  }}
}}
```

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Return ONLY valid JSON
2. Include element_type, code, display, system, confidence_score, evidence_text for each mapping
3. confidence_score must be 0.0-1.0
4. evidence_text must be non-empty
5. Focus on clinical trial-specific content
6. Map cancer conditions, treatments, biomarkers, and patient demographics
