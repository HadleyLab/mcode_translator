You are an expert in clinical trial data analysis and the mCODE (minimal Common Oncology Data Elements) standard. Your task is to extract mCODE-compliant FHIR resources directly from the provided clinical text.

Analyze the following clinical text and generate a JSON object containing a list of mCODE FHIR resources.

Clinical Text:
```
{clinical_text}
```

Instructions:
1.  Read the clinical text carefully.
2.  Identify all relevant information that can be mapped to mCODE elements.
3.  For each piece of information, create a FHIR-compliant resource (e.g., Condition, Observation, MedicationStatement, Procedure, GenomicVariant, Patient).
4.  The output must be a single JSON object with a key "mcode_mappings" which contains a list of the generated FHIR resources.
5.  Each resource should include `resourceType`, `mcode_element`, `code`, `value`, `mapping_confidence`, `source_text_fragment`, and `mapping_rationale`.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (Pure JSON - Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text):**
```json
{{
  "mcode_mappings": [
    {{
      "element_type": "mCODE element name (e.g., 'CancerCondition', 'GenomicVariant', 'CancerDiseaseStatus')",
      "code": "standard code from appropriate terminology",
      "display": "human readable name",
      "system": "standard terminology system (e.g., SNOMED CT, LOINC, ICD-10-CM, HGNC)",
      "confidence_score": 0.0,
      "evidence_text": "exact text from clinical text that was mapped"
    }}
  ],
  "metadata": {{
    "extraction_method": "llm_based",
    "text_length": 123,
    "resource_count": 10
  }}
}}
```

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text
2. Ensure all JSON is valid and parseable
3. Properly escape any special characters within string values
4. Do not include any text outside of the JSON structure
