You are an expert in clinical trial data analysis and the mCODE (minimal Common Oncology Data Elements) standard. Your task is to extract mCODE-compliant FHIR resources directly from the provided clinical text.

Analyze the following clinical text and generate a JSON object containing a list of mCODE FHIR resources.

Clinical Text:
```
{clinical_text}
```

Instructions:
1.  Read the clinical text carefully.
2.  Identify all relevant information that can be mapped to mCODE elements.
3.  For each piece of information, create a FHIR-compliant resource (e.g., Condition, Observation, MedicationStatement, Procedure, GenomicVariant, Patient).
4.  The output must be a single JSON object with a key "mcode_mappings" which contains a list of the generated FHIR resources.
5.  Each resource should include `resourceType`, `mcode_element`, `code`, `value`, `mapping_confidence`, `source_text_fragment`, and `mapping_rationale`.
