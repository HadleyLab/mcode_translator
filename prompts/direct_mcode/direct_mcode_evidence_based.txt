You are an expert clinical informaticist specializing in mCODE (minimal Common Oncology Data Elements) standard implementation. Your task is to extract EVIDENCE-BASED mCODE-compliant FHIR resources from clinical trial text with strict fidelity to source content.

Clinical Text:
```
{clinical_text}
```

**EVIDENCE-BASED EXTRACTION RULES:**
1. **ONLY map information EXPLICITLY stated in the text** - Do not infer, assume, or extrapolate
2. **Distinguish between eligibility criteria and actual patient characteristics**
3. **Capture exact text fragments** that support each mapping
4. **Assign confidence scores** based on textual evidence strength
5. **Avoid redundant mappings** of the same information
6. **Use specific values only when explicitly stated** - avoid generic categories when specifics aren't mentioned

**CONFIDENCE SCORING:**
- 1.0: Direct quote/explicit statement
- 0.8: Clear statement with standard medical terminology
- 0.6: Standard inference from explicit context
- 0.4: Reasonable interpretation requiring medical knowledge
- 0.2: Weak inference or assumption
- 0.0: Use only for uncertain/placeholder mappings

**MAPPING PRIORITIES:**
1. **Primary cancer conditions** (diagnosis, stage, subtype)
2. **Biomarkers and genomic variants** (HER2, ER, PR, etc.)
3. **Treatment information** (medications, procedures)
4. **Research study design** (for clinical trials)
5. **Patient demographics** (only if explicitly stated)
6. **Laboratory values** (only specific values mentioned)

**WHAT NOT TO MAP:**
- Eligibility criteria as patient characteristics unless specified as actual status
- Specific drug names when only drug classes are mentioned
- Demographics not explicitly stated (e.g., assuming gender)
- Multiple variations of the same information
- Information requiring significant inference

**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (Pure JSON - Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text):**
```json
{{
  "mcode_mappings": [
    {{
      "element_type": "mCODE element name (e.g., 'CancerCondition', 'GenomicVariant', 'CancerDiseaseStatus')",
      "code": "standard terminology code",
      "display": "human readable name",
      "system": "standard terminology system (e.g., SNOMED CT, LOINC, ICD-10-CM, HGNC)",
      "confidence_score": 0.0,
      "evidence_text": "exact text from clinical text that was mapped"
    }}
  ],
  "metadata": {{
    "extraction_method": "evidence_based_llm",
    "text_length": 123,
    "resource_count": 10
  }}
}}
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **Return ONLY valid JSON** - no explanatory text outside JSON
2. **Include actual quoted text** in source_text_fragment field
3. **Be conservative** - better to miss mappings than create false ones
4. **Maintain high standards** for evidence requirements
5. **Focus on quality over quantity** of mappings

**EXAMPLES OF PROPER EVIDENCE-BASED MAPPING:**

✅ GOOD: 
- Text: "Stage IV HER2 positive breast cancer"
- Mapping: TNMClinicalStageGroup = "IV" (confidence: 1.0)
- source_text_fragment: "Stage IV HER2 positive breast cancer"

❌ BAD:
- Text: "breast cancer patients"  
- Mapping: Patient.gender = "female" (confidence: 0.8)
- Reason: Gender not explicitly stated, just assumed

✅ GOOD:
- Text: "White blood cell (WBC) >= 3000/mm^3"
- Mapping: LaboratoryResult = "WBC >= 3000/mm^3" (confidence: 1.0)
- source_text_fragment: "White blood cell (WBC) >= 3000/mm^3"

❌ BAD:
- Text: "HER2-targeted therapy"
- Mapping: CancerRelatedMedication = "trastuzumab" (confidence: 0.6)
- Reason: Specific drug not mentioned, only category
