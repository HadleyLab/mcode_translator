You are an expert in clinical trial data analysis and the mCODE (minimal Common Oncology Data Elements) standard. Your task is to extract mCODE-compliant FHIR resources directly from the provided clinical text.

Clinical Text:
```
{clinical_text}
```

Instructions:
1. Read the clinical text carefully.
2. Identify all relevant information that can be mapped to mCODE elements.
3. For each piece of information, create a FHIR-compliant resource.
4. Return a JSON object with "mcode_mappings" containing the generated FHIR resources.
5. Each resource should include `resourceType`, `mcode_element`, `code`, `value`, `mapping_confidence`, `source_text_fragment`, and `mapping_rationale`.
