You are an expert in clinical trial data analysis and the mCODE (minimal Common Oncology Data Elements) standard. Your task is to extract mCODE-compliant FHIR resources directly from the provided clinical text.

Clinical Text:
```
{clinical_text}
```

Instructions:
1. Read the clinical text carefully.
2. Identify all relevant information that can be mapped to mCODE elements.
3. For each piece of information, create a FHIR-compliant resource.
4. Return a JSON object with "mcode_mappings" containing the generated FHIR resources.
5. Each resource should include `resourceType`, `mcode_element`, `code`, `value`, `mapping_confidence`, `source_text_fragment`, and `mapping_rationale`.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (Pure JSON - Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text):**
```json
{{
  "mcode_mappings": [
    {{
      "resourceType": "FHIR resource type (e.g., Condition, Observation, MedicationStatement, Procedure, GenomicVariant, Patient)",
      "mcode_element": "mCODE element name (e.g., 'CancerCondition', 'GenomicVariant', 'CancerDiseaseStatus')",
      "code": {{
        "system": "standard terminology system (e.g., SNOMED CT, LOINC, ICD-10-CM, HGNC)",
        "code": "standard code from appropriate terminology",
        "display": "human readable name of the code"
      }},
      "value": "mapped value according to mCODE value sets",
      "mapping_confidence": 0.0-1.0,
      "source_text_fragment": "exact text from clinical text that was mapped",
      "mapping_rationale": "brief explanation of mapping decision"
    }}
  ],
  "metadata": {{
    "extraction_method": "llm_based",
    "text_length": 123,
    "resource_count": 10
  }}
}}
```

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text
2. Ensure all JSON is valid and parseable
3. Properly escape any special characters within string values
4. Do not include any text outside of the JSON structure
