You are an expert in clinical trial data analysis and the mCODE (minimal Common Oncology Data Elements) standard. Your task is to extract comprehensive mCODE element mappings directly from the provided clinical text.

**TASK: Extract comprehensive mCODE element mappings from clinical text**

**INPUT:**
Clinical Text:
```
{clinical_text}
```

**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (Pure JSON - Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text):**
```json
{{
  "mcode_mappings": [
    {{
      "element_type": "mCODE element name (e.g., 'CancerCondition', 'GenomicVariant', 'CancerDiseaseStatus')",
      "code": "standard code from appropriate terminology",
      "display": "human readable name of the code",
      "system": "standard terminology system (e.g., SNOMED CT, LOINC, ICD-10-CM, HGNC)",
      "confidence_score": 0.0,
      "evidence_text": "exact text from clinical text that was mapped"
    }}
  ],
  "metadata": {{
    "extraction_method": "llm_based",
    "text_length": 123,
    "resource_count": 10
  }}
}}
```

**mCODE ELEMENTS TO IDENTIFY (mCODE STU4 Ontology):**
- Patient Demographics: Birth sex, race, ethnicity, administrative gender
- CancerCondition: Primary cancer diagnoses, cancer types, histology, morphology
- CancerStaging: TNM categories (T, N, M), stage groups (I, II, III, IV, IA, IB, etc.)
- TumorMarkerTest: Biomarker status (ER/PR/HER2 for breast cancer, KRAS/BRAF for colorectal, etc.)
- ECOGPerformanceStatus: ECOG performance status scores (0-5)
- KarnofskyPerformanceStatus: Karnofsky performance status scores (0-100)
- CancerRelatedMedicationStatement: Medication details including dosages, administration routes, frequencies
- CancerRelatedSurgicalProcedure: Surgical procedures with laterality and procedure types
- CancerRelatedRadiationProcedure: Radiation therapy procedures and dosages
- Laboratory Results: Vital signs, blood counts, chemistry panels, tumor markers
- ComorbidCondition: Comorbidities and medical history
- FamilyMemberHistory: Family history of cancer and related conditions
- GenomicVariant: Genetic mutations, variants, and genomic findings
- CancerDiseaseStatus: Disease status (active, remission, progression, recurrence)

**EXTRACTION RULES:**
1. Extract EVERY piece of relevant information mentioned in the clinical text
2. Map to the most specific mCODE STU4 profile possible using the ontology models
3. Use official mCODE value sets and coding systems (SNOMED CT, LOINC, ICD-10-CM, HGNC)
4. Include mapping confidence based on clarity of match (1.0 = explicit, 0.8 = clear, 0.6 = inferred)
5. Provide exact source text fragments for traceability
6. Create structured mCODE element mappings following FHIR resource patterns
7. For demographics: Extract birth sex, race, ethnicity from patient information
8. For staging: Capture complete TNM categories and stage groups
9. For biomarkers: Extract receptor status (ER/PR/HER2) with specific values
10. For treatments: Include medication dosages, administration details, procedure types
11. For labs/vitals: Extract specific values with units and reference ranges
12. For comorbidities/family history: Map to appropriate condition codes

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Map to the most specific mCODE STU4 profile available using ontology models
2. Use official mCODE value sets and coding systems (SNOMED CT, LOINC, ICD-10-CM, HGNC)
3. Include confidence scores for mapping decisions (1.0=explicit, 0.8=clear, 0.6=inferred)
4. Provide exact source text fragments for traceability
5. Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text
6. If no mappings possible, return empty arrays but preserve JSON structure
7. Use exact mCODE STU4 element names: McodePatient, CancerCondition, CancerStaging, TumorMarkerTest, ECOGPerformanceStatusObservation, CancerRelatedMedicationStatement, CancerRelatedSurgicalProcedure, CancerRelatedRadiationProcedure, ComorbidCondition, FamilyMemberHistory, GenomicVariant, CancerDiseaseStatus
8. For structured extraction: Follow FHIR resource patterns with proper coding
9. For demographics: Use BirthSex, USCoreRace, USCoreEthnicity extensions
10. For staging: Extract TNM categories and map to TNMStageGroup enum values
11. For biomarkers: Map to ReceptorStatus enum and specific LOINC codes
12. For treatments: Include dosage, frequency, route, and duration details
13. Properly escape any special characters within string values
14. Ensure all JSON is valid and parseable
15. Do not include any text outside of the JSON structure
