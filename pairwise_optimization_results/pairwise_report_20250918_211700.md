## Summary

- **Total Comparisons**: 100
- **Successful Comparisons**: 100
- **Success Rate**: 100.0%
- **Unique Configuration Pairs**: 80

## Prompt Strategy Analysis

### SNOMED-Enabled Prompts ‚≠ê
**Strategy**: Integrated SNOMED CT code reference table with evidence-based extraction
**Key Features**:
- Pre-defined SNOMED CT codes for common cancer conditions, treatments, and demographics
- Generates actual medical codes instead of null/placeholder values
- Higher code coverage and medical accuracy
- Maintains strict evidence-based approach

### Evidence-Based Prompts üîç
**Strategy**: Strict fidelity to source text with conservative mapping
**Key Features**:
- Only extracts information explicitly stated in source
- No inference or extrapolation
- Prioritizes accuracy over completeness

### Other Prompts üìù
**Strategy**: Various approaches including structured, comprehensive, and minimal extraction
**Key Features**:
- Different levels of detail and structure
- Varying approaches to medical terminology handling
