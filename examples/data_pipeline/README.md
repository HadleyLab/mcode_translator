## Pipeline Architecture

The mCODE Translator uses a sophisticated 7-stage pipeline:

### Stage 1: Data Ingestion
- Fetch clinical trial data from ClinicalTrials.gov API
- Handle API rate limits and retries
- Validate basic data structure
- Cache responses for performance

### Stage 2: Data Validation
- Schema validation against expected structure
- Required field presence checks
- Data type validation
- Basic sanity checks

### Stage 3: Text Extraction
- Extract eligibility criteria and other text fields
- Clean and normalize text content
- Handle missing or malformed data
- Prepare text for processing engines

### Stage 4: mCODE Processing
- **Parallel Processing**: Both RegexEngine and LLMEngine run simultaneously
- **RegexEngine**: Fast, deterministic pattern matching
- **LLMEngine**: Intelligent AI-powered extraction
- **Fallback Logic**: Use RegexEngine results if LLM fails

### Stage 5: Result Aggregation
- Combine results from multiple engines
- Resolve conflicts and duplicates
- Calculate confidence scores
- Generate unified mCODE output

### Stage 6: Quality Assurance
- mCODE compliance validation
- Element relationship verification
- Confidence threshold checks
- Data consistency validation

### Stage 7: Data Export
- Format output for different use cases
- Generate reports and summaries
- Store in CORE Memory (optional)
- Export to files or APIs

- Circuit breaker for persistent issues
- Fallback to alternative engines
- Graceful degradation options

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Real-time metrics collection
- Performance threshold monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- Automated alerting (configurable)

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Checks

- **Relationship Validation**: Logical consistency between elements
- **Confidence Scoring**: Minimum confidence thresholds
- **Completeness Checks**: Required element presence

### Quality Metrics

- **Extraction Completeness**: Percentage of expected elements found
- **Mapping Accuracy**: Correctness of element mappings
- **Validation Score**: Overall data quality score
- **Consistency Score**: Internal data consistency

## Production Deployment

### Scaling Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple pipeline instances
2. **Batch Processing**: Process trials in optimized batches
3. **Caching Strategy**: Cache API responses and intermediate results
4. **Resource Management**: Monitor memory and CPU usage

### Monitoring Setup

```python
from src.utils.metrics import PipelineMetrics

metrics = PipelineMetrics()
metrics.track_stage_duration("ingestion", 0.5)
metrics.track_success_rate("processing", 0.95)
metrics.track_error_rate("validation", 0.02)
```

### Integration Points

- **API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs for pipeline control
- **Message Queues**: Asynchronous processing queues
- **Webhook Notifications**: Real-time status updates
- **Database Storage**: Persistent result storage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **API Rate Limits**: Implement backoff strategies
- **Memory Issues**: Reduce batch sizes or add pagination
- **LLM Timeouts**: Increase timeout values or use fallback
- **Data Quality**: Review validation rules and thresholds

### Performance Tuning

1. **Optimize Batch Sizes**: Balance throughput vs memory usage
2. **Enable Caching**: Cache API responses and patterns
3. **Parallel Processing**: Use multiple engines simultaneously
4. **Resource Allocation**: Monitor and adjust CPU/memory limits

## Next Steps

After running this example:

1. **Scale Testing**: Try with larger datasets (10+ trials)
2. **Custom Configuration**: Modify pipeline stages and parameters
3. **Integration Testing**: Connect with external systems
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up metrics and alerting
5. **Production Deployment**: Configure for production workloads
