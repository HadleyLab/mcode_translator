In this single-center study, we will recruit ten mothers with metastatic breast cancer and their co-parents as dyads (N=20) to participate in the Fathers and Mothers Invested in the Lives of their Youth (FAMILY) intervention. Patient and co-parent dyads will participate in 2-3 study visits with an intervention facilitator and a post-intervention feedback interview.

The final products of this study will be the FAMILY intervention manual and training materials, and fidelity assessments.", "detailedDescription": "Cancer is the leading disease-specific cause of early parental death in the United States and having dependent children worsens suffering for parents with advanced cancer and their families. The FAMILY intervention consists of manualized visits with a trained intervention facilitator and psychoeducation materials to help parents cope with cancer-related parenting concerns. The purpose of the intervention is to improve parenting concerns, emotional well-being, and end-of-life (EOL) preparation among participants. This study will evaluate whether a psychosocial intervention to reduce psychological distress and improve EOL preparation for mothers with metastatic breast cancer and their co-parents can be acceptable, feasible, and relevant to the target patient population.\n\nThis study is needed in order to generate critical data to: (1) refine the intervention in preparation for a pilot efficacy randomized controlled trial (RCT); and to generate preliminary data demonstrating the feasibility and acceptability of core intervention components.

When patients undergo a lumpectomy, it is difficult for the surgeon to determine the extent of the tumor which results in incomplete tumor removal as determined by a positive margin assessment several days after the initial surgery is completed. Most patients with positive margins will undergo a second or even a third surgery to complete the tumor removal. The investigators hypothesize that the LUM Imaging System can reduce the rates of positive margins and, thus, the rates of second surgeries by identifying microscopic residual cancer in the tumor bed.\n\nThis is a non-randomized, open label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intraoperative imaging system, the LUM Imaging System (LUM015 in conjunction with LUM 2.6 Imaging Device), in identifying residual cancer in the tumor bed of female breast cancer subjects. The study is composed of a Feasibility Trial divided into two phases: Phase A (15 total subjects) and Phase B (up to 50 total subjects). During Phase A, 15 subjects will be evaluated to collect additional patient safety data, select the dose of LUM015 for Phase B and evaluate the device function. During Phase B, subjects will be injected with LUM015 at the dose determined during Phase A to preliminarily assess the performance of the detection algorithm against pathology margin assessment. In Phase B, the surgeon will perform standard of care surgery and then use the LUM Imaging System to guide the removal of additional cavity shavings as indicated by the LUM Imaging System.", "detailedDescription": "The LUM Imaging System consists of the cancer imaging agent LUM015 and a hand-held fluorescence-based imager that collects the emission of activated LUM015 in and around tumor. The LUM Imaging System is designed to detect microscopic residual cancer cells in real-time within the tumor bed. In this study, we will evaluate the performance of the LUM Imaging System in detecting residual cancer and guiding its removal during lumpectomies.\n\nIn Phase A, all patients will receive standard of care surgery followed by intraoperative imaging of the tumor bed and resected tissue with the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device. In Phase A, no clinical decisions are made based on the imaging results. Standard of care margin assessment will be performed and compared against the imaging results with the LUM Imaging System.\n\nSubjects in Phase B will receive standard of care surgery followed by intraoperative imaging of the tumor bed with the LUM Imaging System. In Phase B, the surgeon will remove an additional shaved margin specimen if indicated by the LUM Imaging System. Final margin assessment will be performed on the very last shaved margin specimen removed.\n\nAll participating subjects will be observed to collect safety data from the time of injection of LUM015 to the time the clinical team decides no additional surgery is needed."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Breast Cancer"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE1", "PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "OTHER", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 60, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "LUM Imaging System", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "No dose or a single dose of LUM015 (0.5 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg) will be administered by intravenous injection between 2 to 6 hours prior to surgery.
