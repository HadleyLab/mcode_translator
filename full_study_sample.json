          "briefSummary": "Patients with multiple myeloma experience a wide range of physical and psychological\r\nsymptoms from the time of their diagnosis. Meanwhile, patients with aggressive lymphomas\r\nundergo unpredictable illness courses, resulting in goals of care conversations occurring\r\nlate in the illness trajectory and aggressive care being received in the last 30 days of\r\nlife. Early palliative care alongside usual cancer care has been shown to improve patient\r\noutcomes such as symptom burden, mood, and quality of life in patients with solid tumours\r\n(e.g. lung, breast or gynecological cancers), but has not been explored among patients\r\nwith blood cancers to date.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this clinical trial is to a brief early palliative care intervention for\r\npatients with multiple myeloma and aggressive B cell lymphoma attending the Princess\r\nMargaret Cancer Centre. The main goals of the study are:\r\n\r\n  -  To see if it is possible to apply the early palliative care intervention for\r\n     patients with multiple myeloma and aggressive lymphoma\r\n\r\n  -  To see if this early palliative care intervention works well for these patients\r\n\r\n  -  To compare patient experiences with early palliative care and usual care.\r\n\r\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group will receive early\r\npalliative care in addition to usual care from their blood cancer doctor, and the other\r\ngroup will receive usual care from their blood cancer doctor only. All participants will\r\nbe asked to fill out questionnaires about their symptom burden, mood, quality of life,\r\nand satisfaction with care throughout the study. Some participants will also be asked to\r\ntake part in interviews at the end of the trial to answer questions about their\r\nexperience taking part in the study. Researchers will compare the results between the two\r\ngroups to see if there are any improvements in quality of life for the patients who\r\nreceived early palliative care. The researchers will use the results of this study to\r\nguide in the development of a larger clinical trial.",
          "detailedDescription": "In this study, the investigators will test an early palliative care intervention for\r\npatients with multiple myeloma and aggressive B cell lymphoma in a randomized phase II\r\ntrial in which outpatients with multiple myeloma and aggressive lymphoma will be\r\nallocated to one of two groups: symptom screening alone (usual care) or early palliative\r\ncare (intervention).\r\n\r\nParticipants will be recruited from multiple myeloma and lymphoma outpatient clinics at\r\nthe Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. Consenting participants will complete questionnaires\r\nmeasuring outcomes of quality of life, symptom burden, depression, and satisfaction with\r\ncare at recruitment, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months. After the 3-month follow-up time\r\npoint, select participants will complete a one-time semi-structured interview that\r\nexplores their experiences taking part in the study.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this phase II trial is to assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy\r\nof early palliative care for outpatients with multiple myeloma and aggressive lymphoma.\r\nFeasibility criteria are: (i) accrual of at least 80 patients over 12 months; (ii) \u226560%\r\ncomplete patient-reported outcomes (PROs) at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months;\r\nand (iii) in the early palliative care group, \u226560% of patients have at least one visit to\r\nthe palliative care clinic."
