# Pipeline Task Tracker Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing plan for the enhanced pipeline task tracker with gold standard validation and benchmarking capabilities.

## Test Environment
- Python 3.8+
- Required dependencies installed
- Sample clinical trial data available
- Gold standard data available
- Access to LLM APIs (or mock responses for testing)

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Gold Standard Loading
**Objective**: Verify that gold standard data is loaded correctly

**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Gold standard file exists and loads successfully
- [ ] Gold standard file missing - graceful handling
- [ ] Gold standard file malformed - appropriate error handling
- [ ] Gold standard data structure validation

**Expected Results**:
- Gold standard data is loaded into memory when file exists
- Appropriate error messages displayed when file is missing or malformed
- Application continues to function without gold standard data

### 2. Validation Logic
**Objective**: Verify that validation logic correctly calculates metrics

**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Entity extraction validation with exact matches
- [ ] Entity extraction validation with fuzzy matches
- [ ] Entity extraction validation with no matches
- [ ] mCODE mapping validation with exact matches
- [ ] mCODE mapping validation with partial matches
- [ ] mCODE mapping validation with no matches
- [ ] Compliance score calculation

**Expected Results**:
- Precision, recall, and F1-score calculated correctly for all scenarios
- Compliance score accurately reflects mCODE validation results
- Error handling for malformed validation data

### 3. Benchmarking Metrics Collection
**Objective**: Verify that benchmarking metrics are collected correctly

**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Processing time measurement for each pipeline step
- [ ] Total processing time for complete pipeline
- [ ] Token usage collection from LLM responses
- [ ] Resource usage metrics (if implemented)
- [ ] Summary statistics calculation

**Expected Results**:
- All timing metrics recorded accurately
- Token usage correctly extracted and aggregated
- Summary statistics calculated correctly
- Error handling for missing or malformed metrics data

### 4. UI Display - Validation Results
**Objective**: Verify that validation results are displayed correctly in the UI

**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Validation metrics displayed in task cards
- [ ] Validation metrics displayed in task details
- [ ] Validation summary statistics displayed
- [ ] Color coding for validation status (pass/fail)
- [ ] Error handling for missing validation data

**Expected Results**:
- Validation metrics visible in appropriate UI locations
- Color coding accurately reflects validation status
- Summary statistics updated as tasks complete
- UI gracefully handles missing validation data

### 5. UI Display - Benchmarking Metrics
**Objective**: Verify that benchmarking metrics are displayed correctly in the UI

**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Processing time displayed in task cards
- [ ] Token usage displayed in task details
- [ ] Benchmarking summary statistics displayed
- [ ] Resource usage metrics displayed (if implemented)
- [ ] Error handling for missing benchmarking data

**Expected Results**:
- Benchmarking metrics visible in appropriate UI locations
- Summary statistics updated as tasks complete
- UI gracefully handles missing benchmarking data

### 6. End-to-End Pipeline Execution
**Objective**: Verify complete pipeline execution with validation and benchmarking

**Test Cases**:
- [ ] NLP to mCODE pipeline with validation and benchmarking
- [ ] Direct to mCODE pipeline with validation and benchmarking
- [ ] Pipeline execution with successful validation
- [ ] Pipeline execution with failed validation
- [ ] Pipeline execution with benchmarking metrics collection
- [ ] Concurrent pipeline execution (multiple tasks)

**Expected Results**:
- Complete pipeline executes successfully
- Validation metrics calculated and displayed
- Benchmarking metrics collected and displayed
- Concurrent execution works without conflicts

### 7. Error Handling
**Objective**: Verify robust error handling throughout the system

**Test Cases**:
- [ ] LLM API failure during extraction
- [ ] LLM API failure during mapping
- [ ] Invalid gold standard data
- [ ] Missing prompt files
- [ ] Invalid configuration
- [ ] Network connectivity issues

**Expected Results**:
- Appropriate error messages displayed
- System recovers gracefully from errors
- Partial results preserved when possible
- Application remains stable

## Test Data
### Sample Clinical Trial Data
- Breast cancer HER2-positive trial data
- Multiple test cases with varying complexity

### Gold Standard Data
- Expected extraction entities with text, type, and attributes
- Expected mCODE mappings with element types and values

### Test Configurations
- Various prompt configurations
- Different model configurations
- Multiple pipeline types (NLP to mCODE, Direct to mCODE)

## Testing Tools
### Unit Testing
- pytest for unit tests
- Mock objects for LLM API responses
- Test data fixtures

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end pipeline execution tests
- UI interaction tests
- Data persistence tests

### Performance Testing
- Load testing with multiple concurrent tasks
- Memory usage monitoring
- Processing time analysis

## Test Execution
### Automated Tests
1. Run unit tests for validation logic
2. Run unit tests for benchmarking metrics collection
3. Run integration tests for pipeline execution
4. Run UI tests for display components

### Manual Tests
1. Verify UI layout and appearance
2. Test user interactions and workflows
3. Validate error messages and handling
4. Check responsive design on different screen sizes

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All automated tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing confirms correct functionality
- [ ] UI displays validation and benchmarking metrics correctly
- [ ] Error handling works as expected
- [ ] Performance impact is acceptable
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate

## Rollback Plan
If testing reveals critical issues:
1. Revert to previous stable version
2. Identify and fix root cause of issues
3. Re-implement features incrementally
4. Retest with focused testing on fixed areas

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update user guide with validation features
- [ ] Update user guide with benchmarking features
- [ ] Add API documentation for new methods
- [ ] Update README with new capabilities
