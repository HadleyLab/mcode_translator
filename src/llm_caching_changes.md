# LLM Caching Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to implement disk-based caching for LLM calls in the mCODE Translator project.

## 1. Cache Manager Update

The `CacheManager` in `src/utils/cache_manager.py` was updated to include a new `llm_cache`. This cache is responsible for storing LLM responses on disk in the `./cache/llm_cache/` directory.

## 2. StrictLLMBase Class Modification

The `StrictLLMBase` class in `src/pipeline/strict_llm_base.py` was modified to use the new disk-based `llm_cache` instead of the in-memory cache. This ensures that LLM calls are cached across different runs and instances.

## 3. Cache Debugging Script Update

The cache debugging script `cache_debug.py` was updated to recognize and manage the new `llm_cache`.

## 4. Documentation Update

The `CACHE_DEBUGGING.md` documentation was updated to reflect the new caching mechanism.

## 5. Test Script

A new test script `test_llm_cache.py` was created to verify that the disk-based caching for LLM calls is working correctly.
