It belongs to a new class of medications known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Sorafenib is thought to work against cancer in many ways. It helps decrease blood supply to the tumor. It also blocks some proteins that help the tumor cells to grow.\" Sorafenib is approved by the Food and Drug administration (FDA) for treatment for other cancers like liver and kidney cancer. Sorafenib has also been studied in the treatment of breast cancer that has spread but is not specifically approved for the treatment of breast cancer. It has been studied both as a single agent and also in combination with other anti-cancer therapies for breast cancer. In laboratory models and in some patients with other cancers, sorafenib has been studied in tumors in the brain.\n\nIn this study, sorafenib will be given together with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Overall this research study is designed to answer 2 main questions:\n\n1. What dose of sorafenib should be used together with WBRT?\n2. What are the side effects of sorafenib and WBRT when given together?"}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Breast Cancer", "Brain Metastases"], "keywords": ["Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT)", "Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006)", "12-046"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE1"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 21, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Radiotherapy with Sorafenib", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "This is a single institution, open label, prospective, phase I clinical trial using standard 3+3 design.

Determining lymph node status, however, is a challenge. Ferumoxtran-10, an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particle has proven to be a valuable contrast agent for detecting lymph node metastases using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in various types of cancer (also called nano-MRI). For small lymph node metastases (\\<5mm) the diagnostic accuracy of this technique does, however, drop substantially. Most of the studies that have been performed with these particles used a 1.5 Tesla or 3 Tesla MRI scanner. The investigators would like to increase the resolution of nano-MRI by using a 7 Tesla scanner, such that the investigators can increase the sensitivity of this technique for small lymph nodes. With this study the investigators would like to validate the results of this technique with pathology in rectal and breast cancer. In these cancer types many patients undergo a surgical lymph node dissection by bulk excision of tissue including the nodes, enabling a node-to-node comparison between MRI and pathology to validate our nano-MRI results . If successful this technique would form a non-invasive alternative to the current lymph node staging techniques such as surgery.

Intraoperatively, the SCOUT hand-held device is then percutaneously applied to the breast or lymph node, creating an audible signal on the device console with a gradient which correlates to distance (in mm) from the target lesion and marker.\n\nThe Savi Scout surgical guidance system was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2014. Furthermore, it was approved for long term use, with no restrictions on the length of time in 2017.\n\nThe system consists of an implantable reflector with a 4-mm body size, preloaded in a 16-gauge deliverable needle, a hand-held probe and a console. The reflector consists of an IR light receptor, resistor switch and two antennae. This is placed into or near the target through a 16G needle under mammographic or sonographic guidance. The hand-held probe detects pulses of infrared (IR) light and radar wave signals, received by the console system, which then emits and receives signals back to the reflector to provide real time localization and target proximity information to the surgeon.\n\nThe SCOUT console provides audible and visual feedback intraoperatively, the frequency of which increases as the handheld reader approaches the implanted reflector. After excision of the breast lesion, the handheld reader can be used to immediately confirm removal of the reflector, present in the lumpectomy specimen, and subsequent quiescence of radar signal in the breast.", "detailedDescription": "Primary Endpoint:\n\n-To measure success of surgical retrieval of SAVI Scout placed at the time of initial, or mid-chemo, imaging studies.

Arming ex vivo expanded T cells in the laboratory may help the T cells kill more tumor cells when they are put back in the body. Giving combination neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by laboratory-treated T cells before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.\n\nPURPOSE: This phase II clinical trial is studying how well giving laboratory-treated T cells after neoadjuvant chemotherapy works in treating women with stage II or stage III breast cancer undergoing surgery.", "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) in women with stage II-III triple-negative breast cancer without a complete pathologic response (cPR) who receive a regimen of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemoT), surgery, and/or irradiation followed by 8 infusions of \\~10-15 x 10\\^9 Her2Bi-armed activated T cells (ATC) (aATC) given twice per week for 4 weeks in combination with IL-2 (aldesleukin) (300,000 IU/m\\^2/day) and GM-CSF (sargramostim) (250 μg/m\\^2/twice per week) beginning 3 days before the 1st infusion and ending 1 week after the last infusion (defined as immunotherapy).\n\nII. To estimate the change from baseline (pre immunotherapy \\[IT\\]) to post-IT in specific cytotoxicity and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spots (Elispots) of lymphocytes in the blood directed at breast cancer cells.\n\nIII. To investigate if pathologic response and the changes in numbers and proportion of infiltrating cells and cancer stem cells in the tumor at the time of surgery are associated with progressive disease.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nNEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive dose-dense AC-T regimen comprising doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) and cyclophosphamide IV once every 2 weeks for 4 courses followed by paclitaxel IV once every 2 weeks for 4 courses or paclitaxel IV once weekly for 12 weeks. Or, patients receive TAC regimen comprising docetaxel IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, and cyclophosphamide IV once every 3 weeks for 6 courses. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nIMMUNOTHERAPY: Beginning 3 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy, patients receive Her2Bi-armed activated T cells IV over 5-30 minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks. Patients also receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning 3 days before the first T cell infusion and ending 1 week after the last infusion.\n\nSURGERY: Patients then undergo surgical resection of the breast 2 weeks later.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients may be followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Breast Cancer"], "keywords": ["estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer", "HER2-negative breast cancer", "male breast cancer", "progesterone receptor-negative breast cancer", "recurrent breast cancer", "stage IIA breast cancer", "stage IIB breast cancer", "stage IIIA breast cancer", "stage IIIB breast cancer", "triple-negative breast cancer"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 8, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "HER2Bi-armed activated T cells + Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "HER2Bi-armed activated T cells - Total of 4 of the T cell infusions IV over a period of 1 month\n\nCyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, paclitaxel -As prescribed by physician, standard of care.", "interventionNames": ["Biological: HER2Bi-armed activated T cells", "Drug: cyclophosphamide", "Drug: doxorubicin hydrochloride", "Drug: paclitaxel", "Other: laboratory biomarker analysis", "Procedure: neoadjuvant therapy", "Procedure: therapeutic conventional surgery"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BIOLOGICAL", "name": "HER2Bi-armed activated T cells", "description": "Total of 4 of the T cell infusions intravenously over a period of 1 month.", "armGroupLabels": ["HER2Bi-armed activated T cells + Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "cyclophosphamide", "description": "As prescribed by physician, standard of care.", "armGroupLabels": ["HER2Bi-armed activated T cells + Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy"], "otherNames": ["Cytoxan®"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "doxorubicin hydrochloride", "description": "As prescribed by physician, standard of care.", "armGroupLabels": ["HER2Bi-armed activated T cells + Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy"], "otherNames": ["Adriamycin®", "Rubex®"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "paclitaxel", "description": "As prescribed by physician, standard of care.", "armGroupLabels": ["HER2Bi-armed activated T cells + Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy"], "otherNames": ["Abraxane®", "Onxol®", "Taxol"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "laboratory biomarker analysis", "description": "Immune studies will be done pre-immunotherapy, prior to the third infusion of activated T-cells, at the time of surgery, and 1 month after immunotherapy.
