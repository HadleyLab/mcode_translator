It belongs to a new class of medications known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Sorafenib is thought to work against cancer in many ways. It helps decrease blood supply to the tumor. It also blocks some proteins that help the tumor cells to grow.\" Sorafenib is approved by the Food and Drug administration (FDA) for treatment for other cancers like liver and kidney cancer. Sorafenib has also been studied in the treatment of breast cancer that has spread but is not specifically approved for the treatment of breast cancer. It has been studied both as a single agent and also in combination with other anti-cancer therapies for breast cancer. In laboratory models and in some patients with other cancers, sorafenib has been studied in tumors in the brain.\n\nIn this study, sorafenib will be given together with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Overall this research study is designed to answer 2 main questions:\n\n1. What dose of sorafenib should be used together with WBRT?\n2.

Arming ex vivo expanded T cells in the laboratory may help the T cells kill more tumor cells when they are put back in the body. Giving combination neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by laboratory-treated T cells before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.\n\nPURPOSE: This phase II clinical trial is studying how well giving laboratory-treated T cells after neoadjuvant chemotherapy works in treating women with stage II or stage III breast cancer undergoing surgery.", "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) in women with stage II-III triple-negative breast cancer without a complete pathologic response (cPR) who receive a regimen of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemoT), surgery, and/or irradiation followed by 8 infusions of \\~10-15 x 10\\^9 Her2Bi-armed activated T cells (ATC) (aATC) given twice per week for 4 weeks in combination with IL-2 (aldesleukin) (300,000 IU/m\\^2/day) and GM-CSF (sargramostim) (250 μg/m\\^2/twice per week) beginning 3 days before the 1st infusion and ending 1 week after the last infusion (defined as immunotherapy).\n\nII. To estimate the change from baseline (pre immunotherapy \\[IT\\]) to post-IT in specific cytotoxicity and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spots (Elispots) of lymphocytes in the blood directed at breast cancer cells.\n\nIII. To investigate if pathologic response and the changes in numbers and proportion of infiltrating cells and cancer stem cells in the tumor at the time of surgery are associated with progressive disease.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nNEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive dose-dense AC-T regimen comprising doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) and cyclophosphamide IV once every 2 weeks for 4 courses followed by paclitaxel IV once every 2 weeks for 4 courses or paclitaxel IV once weekly for 12 weeks. Or, patients receive TAC regimen comprising docetaxel IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, and cyclophosphamide IV once every 3 weeks for 6 courses. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nIMMUNOTHERAPY: Beginning 3 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy, patients receive Her2Bi-armed activated T cells IV over 5-30 minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks. Patients also receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning 3 days before the first T cell infusion and ending 1 week after the last infusion.\n\nSURGERY: Patients then undergo surgical resection of the breast 2 weeks later.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients may be followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Breast Cancer"], "keywords": ["estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer", "HER2-negative breast cancer", "male breast cancer", "progesterone receptor-negative breast cancer", "recurrent breast cancer", "stage IIA breast cancer", "stage IIB breast cancer", "stage IIIA breast cancer", "stage IIIB breast cancer", "triple-negative breast cancer"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 8, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "HER2Bi-armed activated T cells + Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "HER2Bi-armed activated T cells - Total of 4 of the T cell infusions IV over a period of 1 month\n\nCyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, paclitaxel -As prescribed by physician, standard of care.", "interventionNames": ["Biological: HER2Bi-armed activated T cells", "Drug: cyclophosphamide", "Drug: doxorubicin hydrochloride", "Drug: paclitaxel", "Other: laboratory biomarker analysis", "Procedure: neoadjuvant therapy", "Procedure: therapeutic conventional surgery"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BIOLOGICAL", "name": "HER2Bi-armed activated T cells", "description": "Total of 4 of the T cell infusions intravenously over a period of 1 month.", "armGroupLabels": ["HER2Bi-armed activated T cells + Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "cyclophosphamide", "description": "As prescribed by physician, standard of care.", "armGroupLabels": ["HER2Bi-armed activated T cells + Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy"], "otherNames": ["Cytoxan®"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "doxorubicin hydrochloride", "description": "As prescribed by physician, standard of care.", "armGroupLabels": ["HER2Bi-armed activated T cells + Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy"], "otherNames": ["Adriamycin®", "Rubex®"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "paclitaxel", "description": "As prescribed by physician, standard of care.", "armGroupLabels": ["HER2Bi-armed activated T cells + Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy"], "otherNames": ["Abraxane®", "Onxol®", "Taxol"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "laboratory biomarker analysis", "description": "Immune studies will be done pre-immunotherapy, prior to the third infusion of activated T-cells, at the time of surgery, and 1 month after immunotherapy.

symptoms, physical examination findings, or laboratory abnormalities must have staging studies demonstrating no evidence of metastatic disease (with exception of axillary lymph nodes or mammary nodes); patients with stage IIIA disease must have staging studies demonstrating no evidence of metastatic disease (with exception of axillary lymph nodes or mammary nodes), even if asymptomatic with normal physical examination and laboratory values; such staging studies must include: chest imaging (chest X-ray, computed tomography \\[CT\\], or MRI), abdominal/pelvis imaging (CT or MRI), and bone imaging (bone scan or positron emission tomography \\[PET\\]-scan); abnormalities that are indeterminate and too small to biopsy should be followed with further imaging, as appropriate, but do not exclude patients from the study; abnormalities that are suspicious and large enough to biopsy exclude patients from the study, unless a biopsy is performed and is negative for metastatic disease\n* Serum creatinine =\\< 1.5 x ULN for the lab\n* Pre-entry core biopsy with sufficient material for correlative studies\n* Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) \\>= 45 % (by multigated acquisition scan \\[MUGA\\] or echocardiography)\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Tumor determined to be HER2-positive by immunohistochemistry (3+) or by fluorescent in situ hybridization (HER2/CEP17 amplification ratio \\>= 2.0)\n* Tumors clinically staged as anyT with N3 disease or unresectable disease\n* Evidence of disease progression on neoadjuvant chemo T\n* Definitive evidence of metastatic disease with exception of axillary lymph nodes or mammary nodes\n* Synchronous bilateral breast cancer (invasive or ductal carcinoma in situ \\[DCIS\\])\n* Treatment with biotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to study entry\n* Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc. within 2 weeks prior to the collection of cells\n* Prior history of invasive breast cancer (patients with a history of DCIS or lobular carcinoma in situ \\[LCIS\\] are eligible)\n* Other malignancies unless the patient is considered to be disease-free for 5 or more years prior to randomization and is deemed by the physician to be at low risk for recurrence; patients with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the cervix, carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin\n* Known cardiac disease which precludes their ability to receive planned treatments:\n\n  * Angina pectoris that requires the use of anti-anginal medication\n  * History of documented congestive heart failure\n  * Serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication\n  * Severe conduction abnormality\n  * Valvular disease with documented cardiac function compromise; and\n  * Uncontrolled hypertension defined as blood pressure (BP) that is consistently \\> 150/90 on antihypertensive therapy at the time of registration (Patients with hypertension that is well controlled on medication are eligible)\n* History of myocardial infarction (MI) documented by elevated cardiac enzymes with persistent regional wall motion abnormality on assessment of left ventricular (LV) function (patients with history of MI must have an echo instead of/in addition to a MUGA to evaluate LV wall motion)\n* Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease\n* Other non-malignant systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) that would preclude treatment with any of the treatment regimens or would prevent required follow-up\n* Chronic ongoing oral steroid use at the time of registration for any condition (such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, etc)\n* Administration of any investigational agents within 30 days before study entry\n* Pregnancy or lactation at the time of registration\n* Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other

Gemcitabine is a treatment that is an effective therapy currently available to patients with this type and stage of breast cancer. Frequently, in cancer therapy, combinations of drugs prove more effective as treatment than the same drugs used alone.

In the nineties, the sentinel lymph node procedure, which involves the selective removal of the first few affected lymph nodes, was introduced in clinical practice. Today, conventional axillary dissection is still performed on many women with breast cancer that has spread to the nodes. It is the cause for relevant morbidity in the form of lymphedema, impairment of shoulder mobility, sensation disorders and chronic pain in as much as one third of all women undergoing the procedure.\n\nThe TAXIS trial will evaluate the optimal treatment for breast cancer patients in terms of surgery and radiotherapy. In particular, it will investigate the value of tailored axillary surgery (TAS), a new technique that aims at selectively removing the positive lymph nodes. TAS combines the removal of palpably suspicious nodes with the sentinel procedure. TAS is a promising procedure that may significantly decrease morbidity in breast cancer patients by avoiding surgical overtreatment.\n\nThis trial has the potential to establish a new worldwide treatment standard with hopefully less side effects and a better quality of life, while keeping the same efficacy as provided by radical surgery.\n\nThe main objective of the trial is to show that TAS and axillary radiotherapy (RT) is non-inferior to ALND in terms of disease-free survival of node positive breast cancer patients at high risk of recurrence in the era of effective systemic therapy and extended regional nodal irradiation."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Node-positive Breast Cancer"], "keywords": ["Tailored Axillary Surgery", "TAXIS", "Breast Cancer", "node-positive breast cancer", "phase III trial", "IBCSG 57-18", "ABCSG"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 1500, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "ALND", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Tailored axillary surgery followed by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and regional nodal irradiation excluding the dissected axilla.", "interventionNames": ["Procedure: Tailored axillary surgery - both Arms", "Radiation: Radiotherapy - Arm A"]}, {"label": "No ALND", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Tailored axillary surgery followed by regional nodal irradiation including the full axilla.", "interventionNames": ["Procedure: Tailored axillary surgery - both Arms", "Radiation: Radiotherapy - Arm B"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "PROCEDURE", "name": "Tailored axillary surgery - both Arms", "description": "Axillary lymph node dissection - Arm A", "armGroupLabels": ["ALND", "No ALND"]}, {"type": "RADIATION", "name": "Radiotherapy - Arm A", "description": "Regional nodal irradiation excluding the dissected axilla - Arm A", "armGroupLabels": ["ALND"]}, {"type": "RADIATION", "name": "Radiotherapy - Arm B", "description": "Regional nodal irradiation including the full axilla - Arm B", "armGroupLabels": ["No ALND"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Disease-free survival (DFS)", "description": "The primary endpoint of this trial is DFS, defined as time from randomization until one of the following events, whichever comes first:\n\n* Local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant recurrence\n* Second breast cancer\n* Death from any cause Patients not experiencing an event will be censored at the date of the last available assessment.", "timeFrame": "at the occurrence of the event or latest 20 years after randomization of the last patient"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Overall survival (OS)", "description": "OS will be calculated from randomization until death from any cause.

Diagnostic tools and treatment also are improving continuously.\n\nHowever, for some women, breast cancer diagnosis is difficult, in case of high density breast, breast modifications after surgery… In these cases, breast MRI is currently the best imaging tool, with high sensitivity about 90% but with a lower specificity about 60%, that lead to futile biopsies.\n\nRecently, molecular imaging with PET-CT scan with 18FDG has permitted to widely modify cancer treatment.\n\nHowever, PET-CT scan is not a good imaging tool for initial diagnostic of breast tumor because of a lack in spatial resolution about 8mm. So, researchers developed dedicated PET scan for breast, called Positron Emission Mammography. Our project is in this field of view and is named CLEARPEMSONIC.\n\nFirst clinical studies with PEM showed very good performance of this imaging modality for initial evaluation of breast tumors. PEM performance is not affected by breast density, hormonal status. Spatial resolution is less than 3mm. PEM seems complementary with MRI, adding a better specificity value.\n\nIn the field of CERIMED, ClearPemSonic Project aims to evaluate an new imaging tool which combined PEM scan and ultrasonography.\n\nTechnologic evaluation was made. Now a feasibility study is the first step for clinical applications.\n\nThe main objective of this project is to confirm the feasibility of PEM scan with the ClearPEmSonic.\n\nSecondary objectives are to compare results with other conventional imaging modalities and MRI.\n\nThe gold standard will be histology of the breast tumor."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Breast Carcinoma"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 10, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Breast cancer", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "interventionNames": ["Device: MRI", "Device: PET-CT scan", "Device: PEM scan with ClearPemSonic"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DEVICE", "name": "MRI", "armGroupLabels": ["Breast cancer"]}, {"type": "DEVICE", "name": "PET-CT scan", "armGroupLabels": ["Breast cancer"]}, {"type": "DEVICE", "name": "PEM scan with ClearPemSonic", "armGroupLabels": ["Breast cancer"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "MEASURE the Positron Emission Mammography (PEM)", "description": "the feasibility of PEM scan with the ClearPEmSonic", "timeFrame": "12 months"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "MEASURE the other conventional imaging modalities and MRI.", "description": "to compare results with the different device", "timeFrame": "12 MONTHS"}]}, "eligibilityModule": {"eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \\> 18 years\n* Mammary Néoplasia ready(in position) (diagnosed on histological taking of type(chap) biopsy)\n* Waits whose realization of an imaging TEP-TDM in the 18FDG is required for the coverage(care) of a mammary néoplasia.

All patients who have an area of concern in the breast and are identified by their physician as good candidates for BCS are eligible to participate. Patients will eventually be enrolled across 3 surgical sites (Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre - primary site, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, and North York General Hospital) over a 2 year period. Patient and system-related outcome measures will first be collected using the centre-specific standard of care (Wire-Guided Localization or Radioactive Seed Localization for BCS) to establish a baseline. Subsequently, centers will transition to the MOLLI system, recording corresponding outcomes to be used for temporal comparison. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate clinical and health economic outcomes with MOLLI compared to standard-of-care approaches.", "detailedDescription": "BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n\nIn contemporary breast cancer management, more than 70% of breast cancer patients are eligible for - and select - breast-conserving therapy (BCS). However, issues with cosmesis, patient experience, and treatment workflow efficiency during the therapeutic process have considerable room for improvement.\n\nBCS consists of a surgical procedure whereby the suspicious tumor and a rim of surrounding normal tissue are removed. Up to one-third of all diagnosed breast cancers are non-palpable,and require some form of pre-operative localization to guide precise surgical excision. Currently, options for localization of non-palpable lesions are suboptimal in terms of patient experience, healthcare system resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness.\n\nOne of the most common approaches is radioactive seed localization (RSL). RSL consists of insertion of a small radioactive seed under ultrasound guidance to mark the center and/or borders of the tumor. During the procedure the surgeon uses a hand-held probe to detect the seed and guide surgical excision of the lesion intra-operatively. While RSL is effective the use of a radioactive source is and poses many challenges for patients and staff. Another common approach is wired-guided localization (WGL). WGL involves implantation of a hooked wire to mark the center or outer edges of the lesion. Due to modest cost and relative ease of use, WGL use is widespread, however disadvantages include significant patient discomfort, possible migration of the implanted wire, and potential difficulties in localizing axillary lymph nodes.\n\nWHAT ARE THE INVESTIGATORS DOING?\n\nThe investigative team of surgeons and scientists are examining an alternative approach to BCS called magnetic occult lesion localization and imaging (MOLLI). Analogous to RSL, this procedure involves implantation of a small passive magnetic seed - under ultrasound or mammographic imaging guidance - directly into or surrounding the tumor; during the procedure the surgeon uses a novel hand-held probe to intra-operatively detect the position of this seed and remove the tumor.\n\nWHY IS THE STUDY BEING CONDUCTED?\n\nMOLLI offers many of the same benefits as RSL but without any radiation. MOLLI also has the potential to be more effective and accurate than other localization methods. MOLLI has recently been evaluated as part of a phase I clinical trial and was demonstrated to be a safe and effective localization technology. The goal for the current trial is to evaluate clinical and health economic outcomes with MOLLI compared to standard-of-care approaches to help improve access to a wireless, low-cost, but effective breast lesion localization technology for breast cancer patients.\n\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE STUDY?\n\nAs part of this study, researchers will 1) evaluate identify barriers and facilitators related to MOLLI based on feedback from clinical staff, 2) demonstrate cost-effectiveness of MOLLI and 3) gather information on the participants' experience with the MOLLI seed. At each site, the first 25 participants will be treated with the standard of care for BCS (RSL or WGL), and the second 25 participants will be treated with MOLLI.\n\nARE THERE SIDE EFFECTS?\n\nNo side effects are expected from the study treatments. Possible risks associated with using MOLLI include:\n\nA small risk of bleeding A remote risk of allergic reaction to nickel contained in the MOLLI seeds\n\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER THE STUDY?\n\nParticipants may be contacted by a study team member up to and including 16 weeks (6.5 months) after the procedure to take part in a short telephone questionnaire. The questionnaire should take no more than 5 minutes to complete."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Breast Neoplasm"], "keywords": ["Non-palpable lesion", "Localization", "Lumpectomy", "Breast-Conserving Surgery", "Breast Cancer"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NON_RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "SEQUENTIAL", "interventionModelDescription": "At each site, the first cohort of 25 participants will be treated with the standard of care approach (WGS or RSL) and the subsequent cohort of 25 participants will be treated with MOLLI.", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 41, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Standard of Care WGS or RSL", "type": "NO_INTERVENTION", "description": "Patients will undergo the institutional standard of care approach (WGS or RSL) for BCS.

The peripheral nerve block techniques were suggested to reduce acuter post-mastectomy pain. The study compared the analgesic efficacy of retrolaminar block (RLB) and ESPB in patients undergoing MRM.", "detailedDescription": "Introduction Globally, breast cancer remains the most prevalent cancer among females, with an estimated incidence of 31% and mortality of 15%. Surgery is foremost in managing breast cancer, where modified radical mastectomy (MRM) is the most commonly performed procedure. This procedure implicates vigorous tissue dissection and seroma formation with many postoperative complications. Pain is the main complaint following MRM, affecting up to 50% of women, and 25-60% develop persistent chronic postmastectomy pain.\n\nTherefore, adequate pain control is crucial to postoperative management after MRM. Numerous analgesic methods were suggested to reduce acuter post-mastectomy pain. Opioid-related adverse events include nausea and vomiting, respiratory depression, sedation, and dizziness.\n\nMost mastectomy-related pain originates from the chest wall's sensory nerves. The peripheral nerve block techniques have gained increased interest in treating postoperative pain. The erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is one of these techniques that proved effective in various surgical procedures, including breast surgery. It encompasses injecting the local anesthetic (LA) solution deep into the erector spinae muscle (ESM), which eventually spreads through the paravertebral space. Ultrasound-guided retrolaminar block (RLB) is another approach that was found to be effective for pain relief after thoracic surgery. In RLB, LA is injected into the space between the ESM and the lamina of the thoracic vertebra.\n\nBoth techniques are considered variants of paravertebral block; however, prospective studies comparing RLB and ESPB are limited. Therefore, this study was designed to compare the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided retrolaminar block and erector spinae plane block in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy.\n\nPatients and Methods:\n\nThis randomized single-blinded study was conducted at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo University from October 2022 and finished March 2023. The study was approved by the institutional review board and the scientific committee of the anesthesia department of the NCI and Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University. All participants provided written informed consent before enrollment in the study after fully explaining the procedures and possible complications.\n\nThe study involved 60 female patients scheduled for MRM under general anesthesia with the following inclusion criteria: age 18 to 65, ASA class II or III, and body mass index (BMI) of 20-35 kg/m2. Patients with known sensitivity or contraindication to the drugs used in the study, history of psychological disorders or chronic pain syndromes, contraindication to regional anesthesia (local sepsis, pre-existing peripheral neuropathies, coagulopathy), severe respiratory or cardiac conditions, advanced liver or kidney disease were excluded from the study.\n\nThe patients were randomly allocated into one of two equal groups using computer-generated random numbers in opaque closed envelopes. An independent statistician performed the randomization. The grouping was revealed only when the patient was transferred to the pre-anesthetic room. The RLB Group (n=30) received a preoperative ultrasound-guided retrolaminar block using 20 ml levobupivacaine 0.25%. The ESPB Group (n=30) received a preoperative ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block using 20 ml levobupivacaine 0.25%.\n\nPreoperative assessment included thorough history taking, physical examination, and laboratory and radiological investigations. The patients were instructed to report pain using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst imaginable pain. All patients were premedicated with IV midazolam 0.01-0.02 mg/kg 30 minutes before surgery. In both blocks, a Fujifilm Sonosite M-Turbo Ultrasound system linear probe was used (SN.04RQZ6) . After performing blocks lung ultrasound was performed to exclude pneumothorax.\n\nRetrolaminar Block Technique The block was performed under complete aseptic precautions. The ultrasound probe was placed on the back in a transverse orientation on the lateral side of the posterior median line to identify the lamina of the 5th vertebra, ESM, and transversospinalis muscles of the target segment. A skin wheal using 3 ml of 1% lidocaine was made 2-3 cm medial to the transducer. A 38-mm 22-gauge regional block needle was advanced using an in-plane technique. When the puncture needle touched the lamina, with no blood, gas, or cerebrospinal fluid observed on aspiration, 20 mL of 0.25% levobupivacaine was administered between the transversospinalis muscle and lamina. The LA diffusion between the lamina and the ESM indicated a successful puncture.\n\nErector spinae plane block:\n\nThe ultrasound probe was placed on the back in a transverse orientation to identify the tip of the T5 transverse process as flat, squared-off acoustic shadows with a faint image of the pleura visible. When the tip of the transverse process was centered on the ultrasound screen, the probe was rotated to a longitudinal orientation. In the parasagittal view, the following layers were visible superficial to the acoustic shadows of the transverse processes: skin and subcutaneous tissue, trapezius, ESM, and T5 transverse process. A skin wheal was made using 3 ml of 1% lidocaine; then, the block needle was inserted in-plane in a cranial-to-caudal direction until contact was made with the T5 transverse process. The correct location of the needle tip in the fascial plane deep to the ESM was confirmed by injecting 0.5-1.0 ml of normal saline and seeing the fluid lifting the ESM off the transverse process without distending the muscle. After aspiration to avoid intravascular injection, 20 ml levobupivacaine 0.25% was injected.\n\nAnesthetic Management:\n\nAll patients were monitored continuously using electrocardiography, non-invasive blood pressure, peripheral O2 saturation, temperature probe, and end-tidal CO2 throughout the surgical procedure. Anesthesia was induced using fentanyl 2 μg/kg and propofol 2 mg/kg IV. Tracheal intubation was facilitated using rocuronium 0.5 mg/kg IV. Anesthesia was maintained with inhaled sevoflurane 2.0-2.5% in oxygen-enriched air (FiO2=0.5). Maintenance doses of rocuronium 0.1 mg\\\\kg were provided every 30 minutes. Paracetamol 500 mg and ketorolac 30 mg were provided as a part of multimodal analgesia. Rescue analgesia of fentanyl 1 μg/kg was given if the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) or heart rate (HR) rose above 20% of baseline levels. The patients were mechanically ventilated at appropriate settings to keep end-tidal CO2 at 30-35 mmHg.\n\nThe first reading of MAP and HR was taken before induction of general anesthesia as a baseline reading. Then, another reading was taken immediately before incision and at 30-minute intervals intraoperatively. Hypotension (reduction \\> 20% of baseline reading) was treated with 0.9% normal saline and/or 5 mg ephedrine in incremental doses to maintain MAP above 70 mmHg. The residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed using neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and atropine 0.02 mg/kg. Extubation was performed after complete recovery of the airway reflexes.\n\nPostoperatively the NPRS score, MAP, and HR were noted immediately on arrival and every 2 hours. Multimodal analgesia was provided as paracetamol 500 mg/6 hours and ketorolac 30 mg/8 hours IV. Rescue analgesia was provided as IV morphine 3 mg boluses when the patient indicated an NPRS score ≥ 4. The total amount of morphine given in 24 hours was recorded, and a maximum dose of 0.5 mg/kg/24 hours of morphine was allowed. Side effects such as nausea, vomiting, sedation, hallucination, and respiratory depression (respiratory rate \\< 10/minute) were recorded. Moderate or severe postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was treated with 0.1 mg/kg of IV ondansetron."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Breast Neoplasms", "Analgesia"], "keywords": ["Analgesics", "Opioids", "Breast Neoplasms", "Postoperative Pain", "Mastectomy", "Nerve block"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "interventionModelDescription": "To determine the analgesic effect of ultrasound guided Retrolaminar Block and Erector Spinae Plane Block in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy regarding the following : 1-Post-operative opioid (morphine) consumption in the 1st 24 hours 2- Postoperative Numeric Pain Rating Scale. 3.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cobimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as eribulin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

Determining lymph node status, however, is a challenge. Ferumoxtran-10, an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particle has proven to be a valuable contrast agent for detecting lymph node metastases using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in various types of cancer (also called nano-MRI). For small lymph node metastases (\\<5mm) the diagnostic accuracy of this technique does, however, drop substantially. Most of the studies that have been performed with these particles used a 1.5 Tesla or 3 Tesla MRI scanner. The investigators would like to increase the resolution of nano-MRI by using a 7 Tesla scanner, such that the investigators can increase the sensitivity of this technique for small lymph nodes. With this study the investigators would like to validate the results of this technique with pathology in rectal and breast cancer. In these cancer types many patients undergo a surgical lymph node dissection by bulk excision of tissue including the nodes, enabling a node-to-node comparison between MRI and pathology to validate our nano-MRI results . If successful this technique would form a non-invasive alternative to the current lymph node staging techniques such as surgery.

There are effective treatments for breast cancer patients experiencing distress, such as individual or group therapy, health education, and medication. Unfortunately, clinicians may not be aware of the symptoms of distress in their breast cancer patients, and some breast cancer patients who could benefit from referral to behavioral health specialists are overlooked. New guidelines recommend that all cancer patients be regularly screened for distress. However, there are unanswered questions about the impact of distress screening conducted on a large scale. Few studies have evaluated the impact of distress screening on important outcomes in breast cancer patients, such as patient experience and use of health care services, as compared to the usual care offered by the health care organization. In addition, oncology clinicians may be uncertain about the benefits of large-scale distress screening, and pilot screening programs have not been uniformly successful particularly in the community oncology setting.\n\nThe overarching goals of this study are to assess the effectiveness of implementing a guideline-recommended distress screening program for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients on improving identification and referral to treatment for highly distressed breast cancer patients, to assess patient-reported outcomes, health services utilization, and implementation outcomes of the program. This study will address two main research questions: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of a guideline-recommended distress screening program for breast cancer patients in improving identification of distressed patients, initiation and completion of referrals to behavioral health, and patient-reported and utilization outcomes as compared to usual care; 2) Identify the barriers, facilitators, and other implementation-related outcomes related to distress screening in the community oncology setting.\n\nPlease note: This study did not require a DSMB, as it falls under the exception for low-risk behavioral studies.", "detailedDescription": "Background and Study Aims:\n\nBreast cancer patients are at risk for physical and psychosocial harms. Among the most highly prevalent psychosocial issues in breast cancer patients is psychological distress. Distress is defined and assessed as psychiatric morbidity or prevalence of psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety and depression. It is estimated that 40-50% of women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer will experience distress in the year following diagnosis. There is a rich literature on the persistent negative effects of distress in breast cancer patients, including associations with decreased physical and social functioning, increased symptom burden, higher utilization of inpatient and emergency services, and poor quality of life. Psychological distress can also adversely affect individual work productivity, and contributes to the rising costs of cancer care.\n\nRecent guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and others recommend routine distress screening for breast cancer patients, recognizing the availability of effective treatments for psychological distress. Unfortunately distress remains under-detected and undertreated in breast cancer patients and rates of adherence to ASCO and other guidelines is very low. Low rates of screening might be explained in part by limited evidence of effectiveness: while efficacy of distress screening has been demonstrated in small-scale trials at academic centers, typically showing increases in number of referrals to psychosocial services, evidence supporting the effectiveness of large scale distress screening programs under routine practice conditions is limited. It is currently unknown if distress screening of breast cancer patients will improve identification of distressed patients or referrals to behavioral health services in non-academic settings. In addition, extant efficacy studies generally fail to measure key impacts and outcomes desired from distress screening, such as patient-reported outcomes (e.g., distress management, satisfaction) and changes in health care utilization (e.g., changes in emergency department use). Implementation-related factors and outcomes have also been largely overlooked in prior research (e.g., clinician acceptability, fidelity of delivery), leaving serious gaps in the understanding of barriers to adoption of distress screening programs and gaps in the knowledge needed to facilitate large-scale, routine implementation of screening.\n\nThe overarching goal of this study is to implement and evaluate a guideline-based distress screening program for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, measuring its effectiveness and impacts on key outcomes and examining barriers and facilitators to routine adoption. There is a critical need for translational research to assess the effectiveness of distress screening programs in improving (a) identification of distress, (b) referral for services, (c) outcomes for breast cancer patients in real-world oncology settings, and in understanding implementation barriers and facilitators. Without evidence of effectiveness, it is unlikely that clinical and operational health system leaders will invest in distress screening programs, potentially leading to serious adverse consequences. This proposed translational research is crucial in order to bridge the gap between academic studies and non-academic, community oncology practice, where the majority of breast cancer patients are treated. In addition, gaining insight and understanding into barriers and facilitators to implementation of distress screening programs is critically important. The objectives are to assess the effectiveness of the recommended screening program from the joint task force of the American Psychosocial Oncology Society, Association of Oncology Social Work, and Oncology Nursing Society on improving identification and referral to treatment for highly distressed breast cancer patients within an integrated health care system, and to assess patient-reported outcomes, health services utilization, and implementation outcomes of the program.\n\nSpecific Aims:\n\nAim 1: Evaluate the effectiveness of a guideline-recommended distress screening program for breast cancer patients in improving identification of distressed patients, initiation and completion of referrals to behavioral health, and patient-reported and utilization outcomes as compared to usual care within Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), using a pragmatic cluster randomized control trial design at six medical centers.\n\nAim 2: Identify patient-, clinician-, and system-level barriers and facilitators to implementation of the program, and assess stakeholder-perceived acceptability, fidelity, and achievements of the program.\n\nStudy Methods The setting for this research is Kaiser Permanente Southern California, a large, integrated health care system with 14 medical centers serving a highly diverse population of over 4 million members. The investigators will use a novel hybrid effectiveness-implementation study design that allows for dual study of the clinical effectiveness and implementation-related factors to address the need for evidence in both areas. This study will employ mixed methods, collecting both qualitative and quantitative data as appropriate to address the study aims. To evaluate effectiveness, this study will use a cluster randomized control trial (RCT) design, clustered at the medical center level, and will implement the program at the intervention sites and offering screening to all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. To evaluate the effectiveness of the program, the investigators will collect structured data from the KPSC electronic record (referral initiation/completion, use of health services) and patient-reported data (functioning, symptom management). Existing work from a pilot primary care-based distress screening program will be leveraged for this research, demonstrating the feasibility of this study. Implementation outcomes will be assessed with qualitative and survey data.\n\nKnowledge gained from this research will be used to inform the continued development and implementation of systematic distress screening programs for breast cancer patients, and will enrich the evidence base by providing critical information on relevant patient- and system-level outcomes. These results will have an impact on the quality of life and quality of care for these patients, and will directly influence distress screening program adoption, scale-up, and spread, making this work highly relevant to breast cancer patients throughout California and across the nation."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Breast Cancer"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "OBSERVATIONAL", "patientRegistry": false, "designInfo": {"observationalModel": "OTHER", "timePerspective": "PROSPECTIVE"}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 1436, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Intervention", "description": "Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients will be offered a brief distress screening questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), around the time of their breast cancer diagnosis and again at subsequent transitions in care as appropriate (e.g., the initiation of chemotherapy).", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Distress screening"]}, {"label": "Control", "description": "Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients will experience usual care."}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Distress screening", "description": "A brief depression and anxiety screening instrument, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), will be administered to newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in the Distress Screening arm.", "armGroupLabels": ["Intervention"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Number of Participants Offered and Screened for Distress", "description": "\\# of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients offered and screened with the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 at their initial consult", "timeFrame": "Patients assessed during initial consult - e.g. 1 day during 60 min consult"}, {"measure": "Number of Participants Offered an Appropriate Referral", "description": "For patients who had screening done in Oncology, appropriate action for those with a medium/high PHQ-9 is a referral to social work, psychiatry, depression care management.", "timeFrame": "Patients assessed during initial consult - e.g. 1 day during 60 min consult"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, Breast Cancer (FACT-B)", "description": "Self-reported for physical well-being; social family well-being; emotional well-being; functional well-being; and additional concerns over the past 7 days; scale: 0=not at all; 1=a little bit; 2=somewhat; 3=quite a bit; 4=very much; responses indicate symptoms/concerns in the past 7 days.

In this setting ,the emphasis is on alleviation of symptoms and preservation or improvement of quality of life. A large body of clinical evidence documents the effectiveness of local-field external beam radiotherapy in palliation of pain from osseous metastases (1). Despite this general agreement, controversy remains regarding the optimal dose and fractionation schedule. Prospective phase III clinical trials (2-6), today, have failed to demonstrate superiority of one schedule over another ,and as a result, the patterns of practice of remain diverse in duration and intensity.\n\nBetween 1974 and 1980 the RTOG conducted a large national study to determine the effectiveness of five different dose fractionation schedules(2). A total of 1016 patients were entered ,266 into a \"solitary metastasis\" stratum, and 750 into a \"multiple metastasis \" stratum. The former were randomly assigned to treatment with 40,5Gy in 15 fractions or 20Gy in 5 fractions. The latter were assigned to 30Gy in 10 fractions, 15 Gy in5 fractions ,20 Gy in 5 fractions, or 25 Gy in 5 fractions. A quantitative measure of pain ,based on severity and frequency of pain, and the type and frequency of pain medications used, was devised to evaluate response. Overall, 89% of patients experienced minimal relief. There were no significant difference between the treatment arms in both strata. The initial pain score was found to be a useful predictor ; patients with high score were less likely to respond and were less likely to experience a complete response. Patients with breast and prostate cancer were significantly more likely to respond than patients with lung or other primary lesions. Patients completing their treatment as planned had significantly higher rates of complete response than those who did not .While some relief was experienced almost invariably within the first four weeks, complete relief was first reported later than four weeks after start of treatment in about 50 % of patients .The median duration of minimal and complete pain relief was 20 and 12 weeks ,respectively. There were no significant differences in duration of pain relief between the different arms It was concluded that all treatment dose schedules were equally effective.\n\nA reanalysis of the RTOG study was reported by Blitzer (7).Using a stepwise logistic regression, he examined the effect of the number of fractions, the dose per fraction, and solitary versus multiple metastases, on the probability of attaining complete pain relief and the need for retreatment. This multivariate technique allowed patients with solitary and multiple metastases to be analyzed together. By increasing the number of subjects and events the statistical power of the analysis was outcome. There was no correlation of the time dose factor with outcome (8). It was concluded that the more protracted schedules resulted in improved pain relief.\n\nPrice et al. randomized 288 patients to receive either 8 Gy in one fraction or 30 Gy in 10 daily fractions. Pain was assessed using a questionnaire completed by the patients at the home on a daily basis. No differences were found in the probability of attaining pain relief, the speed of onset or the duration of relief between the two arms(4). Hoskin et al. randomized 270 patients to receive either 4 Gy or 8 Gy in one fraction (3) Pain assessed by the patient) and analgesic usage were recorded before treatment and at 2,4,8 and 12 weeks. At 4 weeks the response rates were 69% for 8 Gy and 44% for 4 Gy (p\\<0.001). The duration of the effect was independent of dose.\n\nTwo other randomized trials have been reported (5,6). Given the small difference in the Biological Effective Dose ( BED) between the arms (6) and the small number of patients accrued (5,6), it is not surprising that no differences between the treatment arms were detected.\n\nRTOG have reported the results of a pooled data dose response analysis (11). A computerized literature search was conducted to identify prospectively randomized clinical studies which addressed this issue and the results of these studies (2 6) were pooled together to form a database for analysis. The endpoint selected for analysis was complete response (CR). It was felt that this endpoint was most likely to be evaluated in a consistent fashion by different investigators. One study (6) was excluded from the analysis because outcome was not reported using conventional definitions of complete and partial response. To allow comparison of the different study arms, the BED was calculated for each schedule. Odds ratios calculated for various dose levels showed a statistically significant increase from 1.00 to 3.32 as the BED increased from 14.4 Gy to 5 1.4 Gy.\n\nFor the first time, RTOG analysis demonstrated a highly significant dose response relationship for palliation of pain from bone metastases with radiotherapy. Furthermore, there was no evidence of flattening of the dose¬-response curve within the dose range tested, suggesting that further gains can be realized at doses outside of the range tested. We propose a phase II clinical trial in which the biological effective dose will be increased by the concurrent use of a radiosensitizer. The main advantage of this approach over escalation of the physical dose is the avoidance of increase in the overall treatment time.\n\nCapecitabine is a fluoropyrimidine carbamate with antineoplastic activity. It is an orally administered systemic prodrug of 5' deoxy 5 fluorouridine (5' DFUR) which is converted to 5 Capecitabine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In the liver, a 60 kDa carboxyesterase hydrolyzes much of the compound to 5' deoxy 5 fluorocytidine (5' DFCR). Cytidine deaminase, an enzyme found in most tissues, including tumors, subsequently converts 5' DFCR to 5' deoxy 5 fluorouridine (5' DFUR).. The enzyme, thymidine phosphorylase (dThdPase), then hydrolyzes 5' DFUR to the active drug 5 FU. Many tissues throughout the body express thymidine phosphorylase. Some human carcinomas express this enzyme in higher concentrations than surrounding normal tissues. Both normal and tumor cells metabolize 5 FU to 5¬fluoro 2 deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5 fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP). These metabolites cause cell injury by two different mechanisms. First, HUMP and the folate cofactor, N5 10¬methylenetetrahydrofolate, bind to thymidylate synthase (TS) to form a covalently bound ternary complex. This binding inhibits the formation of thymidylate from uracil. Thymidylate is the necessary precursor of thymidine triphosphate, which is essential for the synthesis of DNA, so that a deficiency of this compound can inhibit cell division. Second, nuclear transcriptional enzymes can mistakenly incorporate FUTP in place of uridine triphosphate (UTP) during the synthesis of RNA. This metabolic error can interfere with RNA processing and protein synthesis. Capecitabine is already approved for use in patients with metastatic breast cancer resistant to both paclitaxel and an anthracycline containing chemotherapy regimen.\n\nAlthough 5FU is an established radiosensitizer, the exact mechanism by which it enhances cell kill is not well understood. Sensitization is schedule dependent and is maximal when a cytocidal concentration of 5FU is given after the radiation exposure (12). The effect does not result from increased sublethal damage or inhibition of sublethal damage repair (12,13). Current evidence suggests that radiosensitization by 5FU is mediated through its effects on DNA rather then RNA (14). In vivo (15) as well as clinical studies (16) have demonstrated the superiority of continuous over bolus infusion of 5FU.\n\nOver the last several decades, concurrent 5FU and radiation have been used successfully in a variety of malignancies. Several important lessons have been learned from clinical trials (16). Simultaneous delivery of large (IV bolus) doses of 5 fluorouracil with irradiation is associated with improved survival compared to treatment with radiation alone, but at a price of increased normal tissue toxicity. These side effects can be ameliorated by using protracted venous infusion. This is an efficacious approach, with a wide therapeutic index, which permits concurrent treatment of micrometastatic disease and radiation sensitization.\n\nCombined modality therapy, including irradiation and concurrently administered 5FU based chemotherapy, has become the mainstay of therapy for anal and rectal cancers. Protracted venous infusion chemoradiation is also used in the preoperative management of rectal cancer and in the nonoperative management of anal cancers. The Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG) has demonstrated a significant survival advantage for patients who receive adjuvant combined radiation and bolus 5FU following curative resection of pancreatic cancer (17,18). Similar advantages have been demonstrated in unresectable pancreatic cancers. Significant advantages have also been shown for concurrent chemotherapy regiments containing 5FU in esophageal cancer (19), squamous cell carcinoma of the Head and Neck (20,21), and carcinoma of the cervix (22).\n\nThere is very limited experience with the use of capecitabine and radiation. Based on its relative selectivity and the increase in tumor cell 5FU levels, it should be expected that capecitabine will provide superior radiosensitization at equivalent or reduced systemic toxicity levels. Interestingly, it has been recently reported that radiation induces thymidine phosphorylase and enhances the efficacy of capecitabine in human cancer xenografts (23). This may further enhance the synergistic effects, and consequently the therapeutic ratio.\n\nIn RTOG study a substantial number of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies treated with concurrent radiotherapy and capecitabine at a dose of 1600 mg/m2/day (5 days a week) with very little toxicity(24 ).In phase II study of chemoradiation for rectal cancer 1650mg/m2/d of capecitabine for 14 days was safe and well-tolerated treatment(25).\n\nIn this study we will investigate the feasibility of concurrent Capecitabine and external beam radiotherapy, as well as collect preliminary data regarding the efficacy of this regimen.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nHypothesis: Given the hypothesis that regimens employing greater intensity radiation yield higher rates of pain relief, radiosensitization using a tumor targeted drug like Xeloda should improve the rate of complete pain relief as compared to radiosensitization with 5FU alone.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo determine the frequency and duration of pain relief and narcotic relief for the proposed regimen.\n\nSecondary Objective:\n\nTo determine the toxicity of concurrent Capecitabine and radiotherapy in breast cancer patients with bone metastases.\n\nEligibility Criteria\n\nPatients with metastatic breast will be allowed on the study regardless of their prior exposure to chemotherapy.

Equal weighting is recommended, although unequal weighting may be used for the lumbar or sacral spine with a ratio of doses of 1:2 AP:PA. Dose will be prescribed at mid depth at the central axis, or at the center of target volume if unequal weighting is used.\n\n   Alternatively, the lumbar spine may be treated with a single PA field, with the dose prescribed to the mid vertebral body as defined by a lateral simulator film.\n4.

The cervical spine may be treated with either parallel opposed lateral fields or with a single posterior field. When lateral fields are used, the isocenter should be at mid thickness, with the dose prescribed to the mid vertebral body.\n6. Pubic. bone lesions will be treated with a single anterior field at a depth determined by lateral radiograph or CT scan.\n7. Clavicular lesions will be treated with a single anterior field at a depth of 3 cm. The dose will be prescribed to the 3 cm depth. An alternative depth may be used as determined by CT scan or other radiographs.\n8. Rib metastases may be treated with electrons or with photons. When electrons are used, the appropriate energy should be chosen such that the entire lesion is covered by the 90% (or higher) isodose curve. The dose will be prescribed to the 100% isodose line. When photons are used, parallel opposed fields may be used, with the depth prescribed to the mid thickness. Tangential fields are strongly encouraged to avoid treatment of underlying structures. A single field may be used to cover the lesion, with the depth set at the estimated depth of the rib lesion, and the dose prescribed to that level.\n9. When more than one osseous site is to be included into a treatment field, the treating radiation oncologist may use different field arrangements at herlhis discretion, with the goal of providing relatively uniform coverage of the target sites and minimum inclusion of uninvolved tissues.\n\nRadiation Dose\n\nAll patients will receive radiotherapy to a dose 30 Gy in 10fractions (3 Gy per fraction) over two weeks.\n\nCHEMOTHERAPY\n\nChemotherapy with capecitabine tablets will be given concurrently with radiotherapy in the dose 1400 mg/m2 orally, in two daily divided doses.\n\nTotal daily dose rounded to the nearest 500 mg and divided into morning and evening\n\nDoses, as per the following table:\n\nNumber of 500 mg tablets to be taken Surface Area Total Daily Dose morning evening (m2) (mg)\\* \\<= 1.08 1000 1 1 1.09 1.4 1500 2 1 1.41 1.71 2000 2 2 1.72 2.02 2500 3 2\n\n\\*Total Daily Dose rounded to the nearest 500 mg and divided into morning and evening doses.\n\nDose Limiting Toxicity\n\ni) \\>grade 3 non hematologic toxicity, except for diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, alopecia, fever and/or local reactions.\n\nii) grade 4 diarrhea lasting \\>3 days which is not controllable with loperamide or other such medications. Or grade 4 diarrhea that requires IV hydration.\n\niii) grade 4 neutropenia lasting \\>3 days\n\niv) grade 4 thrombocytopenia\n\nv) grade 2 hand foot syndrome. Dose adjustments will be as per the following table:\n\nToxicity NCI Grades During a Course of Therapy Grade 1 Maintain dose Grade 2 1st appearance (non HFS) Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1\n\n1st appearance of HFS Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 75 % of original dose.\n\n2nd appearance Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 75 % of original dose.\n\n3rd appearance Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 50 % of original dose.\n\n4th appearance Discontinue treatment permanently Grade 3\n\n1. st appearance Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 75 % of original dose with prophylaxis where possible.\n2. nd appearance Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 50 % of original dose.\n3. rd appearance Discontinue treatment permanently Grade 4\n\n1st appearance Discontinue permanently or If physician deems it to be in the patient's best interest to continue, interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 50 % of original dose .\n\nDosage modifications are not recommended for grade 1 events. Therapy with capecitabine should be interrupted upon the occurrence of a grade 2 or 3 adverse experience. Once the adverse event has resolved or decreased in intensity to grade 1, then therapy may be restarted at full dose or as adjusted according to the above table. If a grade 4 experience occurs, therapy should be discontinued or interrupted until resolved or decreased to grade 1, and therapy should be restarted at 50% of the original dose. Doses of capecitabine omitted for toxicity are not replaced or restored; instead the patient should resume the planned treatment cycles. Once the dose has been reduced it should not be increased at a later time.\n\nToxicity\n\nCAPECITABINE can induce diarrhea, sometimes severe. Patients with severe diarrhea should be carefully monitored and given fluid and electrolyte replacement if they become dehydrated. National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC grade 2 diarrhea is defined as an increase of 4 to 6 stools/day or nocturnal stools, grade 3 diarrhea as an increase of 7 to 9 stools/day or incontinence and malabsorption, and grade 4 diarrhea as an increase of \\>10 stools/day or grossly bloody diarrhea or the need for parenteral support. If grade 2, 3 or 4 diarrhea occurs, administration of capecitabine should be immediately interrupted until the diarrhea resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. Following grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, subsequent doses of capecitabine should be decreased. Standard antidiarrheal treatments (eg, loperamide) are recommended. Necrotizing enterocolitis (typhlitis) has also been reported.\n\nHand and foot syndrome (palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia or chemotherapy induced acral erythema) is characterized by the following: numbness, dysesthesia/paresthesia, tingling, painless or painful swelling, erythema, desquamation, blistering and severe pain. Grade 2 hand and foot syndrome is defined as painful erythema and swelling of the hands and/or feet and/or discomfort affecting the patient's activities of daily living. Grade 3 hand and¬foot syndrome is defined as moist desquamation, ulceration, blistering and severe pain of the hands and/or feet and/or severe discomfort that causes the patient to be unable to work or perform activities of daily living. If grade 2 or 3 hand and foot syndrome occurs, administration of capecitabine should be interrupted until the event resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. Following the occurrence of grade 2 handand foot syndrome, subsequent doses of capecitabine should be decreased.\n\nThere has been cardiotoxicity associated with fluorinated pyrimidine therapy, including myocardial infarction, angina, dysrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, sudden death and electrocardiograph changes. These adverse events may be more common in patients with a prior history of coronary artery disease.\n\nPatients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction due to liver metastases should be carefully monitored when capecitabine is administered. The effect of severe hepatic dysfunction on the disposition of capecitabine is not known. If drug related grade 2 4 elevations in bilirubin occur, administration of capecitabine should be immediately interrupted until the hyperbilirubinernia resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. NCIC grade 2 hyperbilirubinernia is defined as 1.5 x normal, grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia as 1.5 3 x normal and grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia as \\>3 x normal.\n\nIncreases in adverse events have been noted in patients with reduced renal function. Therefore, patients will be excluded for a calculated creatinine clearance of less than 50 ml/min.\n\nMyelosuppression was rare.\n\nAssessment of Response\n\nPain scores and narcotic scores will be determined using the guidelines in following table:\n\nPAIN AND NARCOTIC CATEGORIES AND SCORES PAIN ANALGESIA Severity 0 No pain 0 None I Mild I Analgesics (ASA, Bufferin, Tylenol, Anacin, etc.) 2 Moderate 2 Mild Narcotic, (\\< 112 gr. codeine, Darvon, etc.) 3 Severe 3 Moderate Narcotic (\\> 112 \\< gr. codeine, Percoan, etc) 4 Strong 4 Narcotic, (\\> 1 gr. codeine, demerol, morphine, etc) Frequency 0 None 0 None I Occasional (\\< daily) I p.r.n. (\\< daily) 2 Intermittent (at least daily) 2 q.d. (I tab. or cap./day) 3 Frequent (\\>. I \\< 3 daily) 3 b.i.d. t.i.d. (\\> I \\< 4 tab. or cap./day) 4 Constant (most of the time) 4 \\> t.i.d. (\\> 4 tab. or cap./day)\n\nPain Score = Pain Severity Grade x Pain Frequency Grade Narcotic Score = Analgesia Severity Grade x Analgesic Frequency Grade\n\nResponse will be evaluated by questionnaires at follow up visit at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy and by phone call interviews (when necessary for completeness) in poor compliance patients.\n\nThe \"worst pain score\" will be used as response endpoint. The time to maximal pain relief is the time from the first day of irradiation to the time of the lowest pain score for average pain.\n\nResponse Definitions\n\nComplete response is defined as an average pain score of 0 for two consecutive analysis periods. Narcotic consumption must not be increased. Partial response. A decrease of at least 2 points in the worst pain score for two consecutive analysis periods. Narcotic consumption must not be increased. No response (any of the following): A pain score that does not change within 8 weeks from the start of radiation therapy.\n\nA 2 point increase in worst pain score that is sustained at a higher level in the month following the first day of radiation therapy.\n\nA pain score that drops by at least 2 points and subsequent sustained rise (on 2 successive questionnaires) of pain score by at least 2 points. Any patient with progressive pain in the treated area should have plain radiographs of the area to assess for bone stability and pathologic fracture.\n\nReferences.\n\n1\\.\n\nHoskin PJ.

Female subjects of childbearing potential have a negative pregnancy test at screening. Females of childbearing potential are defined as sexually mature women without prior hysterectomy or who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months. However, women who have been amenorrhoeic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, anti-estrogens, or ovarian suppression.\n\n   * Women of childbearing potential (i.e., menstruating women) must have a negative urine pregnancy test (positive urine tests are to be confirmed by serum test) documented within the 24-hour period prior to the first dose of study drug.\n   * Sexually active women of childbearing potential enrolled in the study must agree to use two forms of accepted methods of contraception during the course of the study and for 3 months after their last dose of study drug. Effective birth control includes (a) intrauterine device (IUD) plus one barrier method; (b) on stable doses of hormonal contraception for at least 3 months (e.g., oral, injectable, implant, transdermal) plus one barrier method; (c) 2 barrier methods. Effective barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm); or (d) a vasectomized partner.\n   * For male patients who are sexually active and who are partners of premenopausal women: agreement to use two forms of contraception during the treatment period and for at least 3 months after the last dose of study drug.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. History of myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome or concomitant sickle cell disease.\n2. Received chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.\n3. Received prior docetaxel treatment, except adjuvant docetaxel given \\> 1 year prior to first dose of study drug\n4. Phase 3 only: Received \\>/= 5 lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic breast cancer (adjuvant chemotherapy will count as one line of chemotherapy, and any hormonal or biological, non conjugate therapy \\[e.g., trastuzumab\\] will not count as a line of therapy).\n5. Current use of strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors, within 3 days of the first administration of study drug, and 7 days after treatment with taxanes OR requires use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors\n6. Received an investigational agent or tumor vaccine within 2 weeks before the first dose of study drug; patients must have recovered from toxicity of prior treatment and have no \\> Grade 1 CTCAE (v4.03) treatment emergent AEs.\n7. Receiving any concurrent anticancer therapies (except continued hormonal treatment).\n8. Received a prior bone marrow or stem cell transplant.\n9. Has a co-existing active infection or received systemic anti-infective treatment within 72 hours before the first dose of study drug.\n10. Prior radiation therapy within the 4 weeks before the first dose of study drug.\n11. Prior use of pegfilgrastim or filgrastim within 4 weeks before the first dose of study drug.\n12. Presence of any serious or uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to: uncontrolled diabetes, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled arterial thrombosis, symptomatic pulmonary embolism, or psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with study requirements, or any other conditions that would preclude the patient from study treatment as per the discretion of the Investigator.\n13. Significant cardiovascular history:\n\n    * History of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease within 1 year (within a window of up to 18 days less than 1 year) before first study drug administration;\n    * Uncontrolled arrhythmia;\n    * History of congenital QT prolongation;\n    * Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings consistent with active ischemic heart disease;\n    * New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease;\n    * Uncontrolled hypertension: blood pressure consistently \\>150 mm Hg systolic and \\> 100 mm Hg diastolic in spite of antihypertensive medication.\n14. History of hemorrhagic diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, or active uncontrolled peptic ulcer disease. (Concomitant therapy with ranitidine or its equivalent and/or omeprazole or its equivalent is acceptable). History of ileus or other significant gastrointestinal disorder known to predispose to ileus or chronic bowel hypomotility.\n15. Any other malignancy requiring active therapy.\n16. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity.\n17. Active Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection which requires antiviral treatment. Patients with detectable Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg) may be eligible provided the patient has a negative viral load. Patients with a positive HBsAg must have a negative viral load before each chemotherapy administration. Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti HBs) without detectable HBsAg does NOT exclude patients from the study. Hepatitis C infection (Hepatitis C antibody reactive) which requires treatment also excludes patients from the study.\n18. Female subject who is pregnant or lactating.\n19.

Define the relationship of mGFR and carboplatin clearance in patients with cancer.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the divergence of estimated (e)GFR from mGFR based on patient demographic and other characteristics, thus identifying those most likely to benefit from determination of mGFR over use of eGFR.\n\nII. Determine the success rate of achieving the target carboplatin AUC in patients in whom the carboplatin dose is capped.\n\nIII. Evaluate the relationship between carboplatin exposure and toxicity. IV. Assess the ability of markers other than creatinine in pre-treatment serum to better estimate kidney function in patients with cancer.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive iohexol intravenously (IV) over 30-60 seconds. Patients then receive standard of care carboplatin IV. Patients also undergo collection of 7-8 blood samples for analysis.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up for 3-4 weeks."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Malignant Solid Neoplasm"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE1"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 350, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Treatment (iohexol, standard care carboplatin, blood samples)", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Patients receive iohexol IV over 30-60 seconds.

Even with modern chemotherapy the median survival ranges around 8-10 months.\n\nInhibition of neoangiogenesis seems to be a very promising approach in gastric cancer.\n\nVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) acts as one of the most potent stimulating agents of angiogenesis, and several strategies targeting the VEGF signaling pathway have been developed, including anti-VEGF antibodies, soluble receptors binding directly to VEGF ligand, anti-VEGF receptor (VEGFR) antibodies and VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The breakthrough in the clinical development of anti-angiogenic therapy against colorectal cancer came in 2003 with a large prospective, randomized clinical trial of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against VEGF. Anti-angiogenic therapy has introduced a highly effective, completely new mode of action in this area and is the new standard of care in advanced colorectal cancer.\n\nThe concept of VEGF inhibition is also very promising in gastric cancer. Bevacizumab was investigated in combination with irinotecan and cisplatin in a phase-II trial, including 47 patients with gastric and GE-junction carcinoma. Bevacizumab could safely be given and could improve time to tumor progression by 75% compared to historical controls. Several phase-II trials confirm the tolerability and promising efficacy of bevacizumab in gastric cancer (Bevacizumab + Docetaxel/Oxaliplatin; FOLFOX + Bevacizumab; Docetaxel/Cisplatin/Irinotecan + Bevacizumab). These results were so promising that randomized phase-III trials in the 1st-line and perioperative setting are under way (AVAGAST-trial: Cisplatin /Capecitabine +/- bevacizumab 1st line ; MAGIC-B-trial : ECX +/- bevacizumab perioperative).\n\nTyrosin kinase inhibitors which inhibit VEGF receptors and EGFR are also investigated in gastric cancer with promising efficacy. Pazopanib, an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor, selectively inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)-1, -2 and -3, c-kit and platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R), which results in inhibition of angiogenesis in tumors in which these receptors are upregulated. Pazopanib has the advantage of being an orally available anti-angiogenesis component.\n\nPazopanib shows promising activity in phase-II trials in renal cell cancer, breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma and non small cell lung cancer. A phase-III trial of pazopanib in renal cell cancer (NCT00334282) is completed and resulted in the approval of Pazopanib for this disease. A phase-III trial in soft tissue sarcoma (NCT00753688) is currently performed.\n\nIn phase-I trials, pazopanib was investigated in combination with FOLFOX and Capecitabine/Oxaliplatin. FOLFOX could be administered in full dose with 800 mg pazopanib.

While strong USPSTF guideline recommendations support appropriate screening for early detection and to avoid preventable deaths, breast cancer screening is often underutilized. Increasing breast cancer screening rates is challenging, in part, because it requires complementary decisions from clinicians (e.g., recommend and counsel patients about screening) and patients (e.g., to internalize risks and choose to complete screening). Presently, the lack of interventions directly targeting both clinicians' and patients' decision-making may underscore the relatively stagnant screening rates in the United States. There is a significant need to develop and scale low-cost interventions that increase breast cancer screening while simultaneously addressing the needs of high-risk patients and reducing disparities. Building upon prior work, the investigators propose to develop and test EHR-based clinician and patient nudges, with an additional intensified nudge to high-risk patients, to help increase screening mammography rates.\n\nThis study consists of two complementary and concurrent, cluster-randomized, pragmatic trials to be conducted at Penn and UH."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Breast Cancer"], "keywords": ["Screening", "Mammogram", "Behavioral Economics", "Prevention"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "interventionModelDescription": "For the Penn trial, primary care clinics will be randomized 2:1 to the intervention arm or control arm using covariate-constrained randomization.

Intraoperatively, the SCOUT hand-held device is then percutaneously applied to the breast or lymph node, creating an audible signal on the device console with a gradient which correlates to distance (in mm) from the target lesion and marker.\n\nThe Savi Scout surgical guidance system was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2014. Furthermore, it was approved for long term use, with no restrictions on the length of time in 2017.\n\nThe system consists of an implantable reflector with a 4-mm body size, preloaded in a 16-gauge deliverable needle, a hand-held probe and a console. The reflector consists of an IR light receptor, resistor switch and two antennae. This is placed into or near the target through a 16G needle under mammographic or sonographic guidance. The hand-held probe detects pulses of infrared (IR) light and radar wave signals, received by the console system, which then emits and receives signals back to the reflector to provide real time localization and target proximity information to the surgeon.\n\nThe SCOUT console provides audible and visual feedback intraoperatively, the frequency of which increases as the handheld reader approaches the implanted reflector. After excision of the breast lesion, the handheld reader can be used to immediately confirm removal of the reflector, present in the lumpectomy specimen, and subsequent quiescence of radar signal in the breast.", "detailedDescription": "Primary Endpoint:\n\n-To measure success of surgical retrieval of SAVI Scout placed at the time of initial, or mid-chemo, imaging studies.

The pathology of DMD is a result of non-repaired muscle damage that leads to muscle-tissue replacement by scar tissue, a process known as fibrosis. Currently, there is no effective treatment for the disease. The only therapy offered to these boys are steroids which slightly delayed the disease progression. The boys lose their ability to walk at around the age of 12, and die in the 4th decade of life from severe heart and lung problems.\n\nIn this study investigators will test the efficacy of Tamoxifen treatment in ambulatory DMD boys. Tamoxifen is a drug used for palliative treatment of breast cancer patients and has an outstanding safety profile. In addition, Tamoxifen was tested in the past in boys, for other pediatric indications, and showed an excellent safety with no side effects.\n\nTamoxifen is being tested in this study, as a therapy for DMD, for the following reasons:\n\n(i) it was shown to have anti-fibrotic effect in multiple in-vivo systems; (ii) it assists in the repair of damaged muscles.\n\nIn other words, Tamoxifen is expected to have a synergistic effect on DMD patients, due to its dual mechanism of action. Indeed, Tamoxifen was shown to have significant beneficial effects in the mdx mouse model of DMD. Also, a small compassionate cohort of 3 boys, treated for 6 months with Tamoxifen, yielded very encouraging results."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy"], "keywords": ["Duchenne Tamoxifen"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE1"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 19, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "open label study", "type": "OTHER", "description": "one arm open label study", "interventionNames": ["Drug: Tamoxifen"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Tamoxifen", "armGroupLabels": ["open label study"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "6-minute walk distance (6MWD)", "description": "PT evaluation", "timeFrame": "The six minute walk distance will be tested during the 36 months of the trial.

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Understanding how to best calculate the dose of carboplatin given to patients with cancer may help doctors learn how to improve the use of carboplatin in the future.", "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the success of targeting a carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) with our current approach to dosing carboplatin.\n\nII. Assess the performance of Cockcroft-Gault (CG), four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD-4), and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) based on isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) calibrated serum creatinine in predicting measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) in patients with cancer.\n\nIII. Define the relationship of mGFR and carboplatin clearance in patients with cancer.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the divergence of estimated (e)GFR from mGFR based on patient demographic and other characteristics, thus identifying those most likely to benefit from determination of mGFR over use of eGFR.\n\nII. Determine the success rate of achieving the target carboplatin AUC in patients in whom the carboplatin dose is capped.\n\nIII. Evaluate the relationship between carboplatin exposure and toxicity. IV. Assess the ability of markers other than creatinine in pre-treatment serum to better estimate kidney function in patients with cancer.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive iohexol intravenously (IV) over 30-60 seconds. Patients then receive standard of care carboplatin IV. Patients also undergo collection of 7-8 blood samples for analysis.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up for 3-4 weeks."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Malignant Solid Neoplasm"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE1"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NA", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 350, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Treatment (iohexol, standard care carboplatin, blood samples)", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Patients receive iohexol IV over 30-60 seconds.

Furthermore, it was approved for long term use, with no restrictions on the length of time in 2017.\n\nThe system consists of an implantable reflector with a 4-mm body size, preloaded in a 16-gauge deliverable needle, a hand-held probe and a console. The reflector consists of an IR light receptor, resistor switch and two antennae. This is placed into or near the target through a 16G needle under mammographic or sonographic guidance. The hand-held probe detects pulses of infrared (IR) light and radar wave signals, received by the console system, which then emits and receives signals back to the reflector to provide real time localization and target proximity information to the surgeon.\n\nThe SCOUT console provides audible and visual feedback intraoperatively, the frequency of which increases as the handheld reader approaches the implanted reflector. After excision of the breast lesion, the handheld reader can be used to immediately confirm removal of the reflector, present in the lumpectomy specimen, and subsequent quiescence of radar signal in the breast.", "detailedDescription": "Primary Endpoint:\n\n-To measure success of surgical retrieval of SAVI Scout placed at the time of initial, or mid-chemo, imaging studies.

Total bilirubin \\</= 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). Alkaline phosphatase (AP), alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase \\</= 3 x ULN (\\</= 5 x ULN in case of liver metastases). In case AP is \\>3 x ULN (in absence of liver metastases) or \\>5 x ULN (in presence of liver metastases) AND subject also is known to have bone metastases, the liver specific AP must be separated from the total and used to assess the liver function instead of the total AP.\n7. Are willing and able to comply with all aspects of the treatment protocol.\n8. Provide written informed consent.\n9. Females, age \\>/= 18 years.\n10. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or to use a highly effective methods of contraception (eg, condom + spermicide, condom + diaphragm with spermicide, intra-uterine device, or have a vasectomised partner) having started for at least one menstrual cycle prior to starting eribulin and throughout the entire treatment period and for 30 days (longer if appropriate) after the last dose of eribulin. Those women using hormonal contraceptives must also be using an additional approved method of contraception (as described previously). Perimenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential.\n\nExclusion Criteria Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in the treatment protocol:\n\n1. Eligible for any other eribulin study that is open in the same region.\n2. Existing anti-cancer therapy-related toxicities of Grade \\>/= 2, except that alopecia and Grade 2 neuropathy are acceptable.\n3.

Subject with hypersensitivity to eribulin or any of the excipients.\n8. Subjects with brain or subdural metastases are not eligible, unless they have completed local therapy and have discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this indication for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment in this treatment protocol. Any signs (eg, radiologic) and/or symptoms of brain metastases must be stable for at least 4 weeks before starting the treatment protocol.\n9. Any history of or concomitant medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the subject's ability to safely complete the treatment protocol.\n10. Subjects who are known to be human immunodeficiency virus positive because the neutropenia caused by the eribulin treatment may make such subjects particularly susceptible to infection.\n11. Subjects with meningeal carcinomatosis.\n12. Pulmonary lymphangitic involvement that results in pulmonary dysfunction requiring active treatment, including the use of oxygen.\n13. Subjects who have received any of the following treatments within the specified period before the start of treatment:\n\n    * Any investigational drug, chemotherapy, radiation, or biological or targeted therapy within 2 weeks.\n    * Hormonal therapy within 1 week.", "healthyVolunteers": false, "sex": "FEMALE", "minimumAge": "18 Years", "stdAges": ["ADULT", "OLDER_ADULT"]},

In this setting ,the emphasis is on alleviation of symptoms and preservation or improvement of quality of life. A large body of clinical evidence documents the effectiveness of local-field external beam radiotherapy in palliation of pain from osseous metastases (1). Despite this general agreement, controversy remains regarding the optimal dose and fractionation schedule. Prospective phase III clinical trials (2-6), today, have failed to demonstrate superiority of one schedule over another ,and as a result, the patterns of practice of remain diverse in duration and intensity.\n\nBetween 1974 and 1980 the RTOG conducted a large national study to determine the effectiveness of five different dose fractionation schedules(2). A total of 1016 patients were entered ,266 into a \"solitary metastasis\" stratum, and 750 into a \"multiple metastasis \" stratum. The former were randomly assigned to treatment with 40,5Gy in 15 fractions or 20Gy in 5 fractions. The latter were assigned to 30Gy in 10 fractions, 15 Gy in5 fractions ,20 Gy in 5 fractions, or 25 Gy in 5 fractions. A quantitative measure of pain ,based on severity and frequency of pain, and the type and frequency of pain medications used, was devised to evaluate response. Overall, 89% of patients experienced minimal relief. There were no significant difference between the treatment arms in both strata. The initial pain score was found to be a useful predictor ; patients with high score were less likely to respond and were less likely to experience a complete response. Patients with breast and prostate cancer were significantly more likely to respond than patients with lung or other primary lesions. Patients completing their treatment as planned had significantly higher rates of complete response than those who did not .While some relief was experienced almost invariably within the first four weeks, complete relief was first reported later than four weeks after start of treatment in about 50 % of patients .The median duration of minimal and complete pain relief was 20 and 12 weeks ,respectively. There were no significant differences in duration of pain relief between the different arms It was concluded that all treatment dose schedules were equally effective.\n\nA reanalysis of the RTOG study was reported by Blitzer (7).Using a stepwise logistic regression, he examined the effect of the number of fractions, the dose per fraction, and solitary versus multiple metastases, on the probability of attaining complete pain relief and the need for retreatment. This multivariate technique allowed patients with solitary and multiple metastases to be analyzed together. By increasing the number of subjects and events the statistical power of the analysis was outcome. There was no correlation of the time dose factor with outcome (8). It was concluded that the more protracted schedules resulted in improved pain relief.\n\nPrice et al. randomized 288 patients to receive either 8 Gy in one fraction or 30 Gy in 10 daily fractions. Pain was assessed using a questionnaire completed by the patients at the home on a daily basis. No differences were found in the probability of attaining pain relief, the speed of onset or the duration of relief between the two arms(4). Hoskin et al. randomized 270 patients to receive either 4 Gy or 8 Gy in one fraction (3) Pain assessed by the patient) and analgesic usage were recorded before treatment and at 2,4,8 and 12 weeks. At 4 weeks the response rates were 69% for 8 Gy and 44% for 4 Gy (p\\<0.001). The duration of the effect was independent of dose.\n\nTwo other randomized trials have been reported (5,6). Given the small difference in the Biological Effective Dose ( BED) between the arms (6) and the small number of patients accrued (5,6), it is not surprising that no differences between the treatment arms were detected.\n\nRTOG have reported the results of a pooled data dose response analysis (11). A computerized literature search was conducted to identify prospectively randomized clinical studies which addressed this issue and the results of these studies (2 6) were pooled together to form a database for analysis. The endpoint selected for analysis was complete response (CR). It was felt that this endpoint was most likely to be evaluated in a consistent fashion by different investigators. One study (6) was excluded from the analysis because outcome was not reported using conventional definitions of complete and partial response. To allow comparison of the different study arms, the BED was calculated for each schedule. Odds ratios calculated for various dose levels showed a statistically significant increase from 1.00 to 3.32 as the BED increased from 14.4 Gy to 5 1.4 Gy.\n\nFor the first time, RTOG analysis demonstrated a highly significant dose response relationship for palliation of pain from bone metastases with radiotherapy. Furthermore, there was no evidence of flattening of the dose¬-response curve within the dose range tested, suggesting that further gains can be realized at doses outside of the range tested. We propose a phase II clinical trial in which the biological effective dose will be increased by the concurrent use of a radiosensitizer. The main advantage of this approach over escalation of the physical dose is the avoidance of increase in the overall treatment time.\n\nCapecitabine is a fluoropyrimidine carbamate with antineoplastic activity. It is an orally administered systemic prodrug of 5' deoxy 5 fluorouridine (5' DFUR) which is converted to 5 Capecitabine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In the liver, a 60 kDa carboxyesterase hydrolyzes much of the compound to 5' deoxy 5 fluorocytidine (5' DFCR). Cytidine deaminase, an enzyme found in most tissues, including tumors, subsequently converts 5' DFCR to 5' deoxy 5 fluorouridine (5' DFUR).. The enzyme, thymidine phosphorylase (dThdPase), then hydrolyzes 5' DFUR to the active drug 5 FU. Many tissues throughout the body express thymidine phosphorylase. Some human carcinomas express this enzyme in higher concentrations than surrounding normal tissues. Both normal and tumor cells metabolize 5 FU to 5¬fluoro 2 deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5 fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP). These metabolites cause cell injury by two different mechanisms. First, HUMP and the folate cofactor, N5 10¬methylenetetrahydrofolate, bind to thymidylate synthase (TS) to form a covalently bound ternary complex. This binding inhibits the formation of thymidylate from uracil. Thymidylate is the necessary precursor of thymidine triphosphate, which is essential for the synthesis of DNA, so that a deficiency of this compound can inhibit cell division. Second, nuclear transcriptional enzymes can mistakenly incorporate FUTP in place of uridine triphosphate (UTP) during the synthesis of RNA. This metabolic error can interfere with RNA processing and protein synthesis. Capecitabine is already approved for use in patients with metastatic breast cancer resistant to both paclitaxel and an anthracycline containing chemotherapy regimen.\n\nAlthough 5FU is an established radiosensitizer, the exact mechanism by which it enhances cell kill is not well understood. Sensitization is schedule dependent and is maximal when a cytocidal concentration of 5FU is given after the radiation exposure (12). The effect does not result from increased sublethal damage or inhibition of sublethal damage repair (12,13). Current evidence suggests that radiosensitization by 5FU is mediated through its effects on DNA rather then RNA (14). In vivo (15) as well as clinical studies (16) have demonstrated the superiority of continuous over bolus infusion of 5FU.\n\nOver the last several decades, concurrent 5FU and radiation have been used successfully in a variety of malignancies. Several important lessons have been learned from clinical trials (16). Simultaneous delivery of large (IV bolus) doses of 5 fluorouracil with irradiation is associated with improved survival compared to treatment with radiation alone, but at a price of increased normal tissue toxicity. These side effects can be ameliorated by using protracted venous infusion. This is an efficacious approach, with a wide therapeutic index, which permits concurrent treatment of micrometastatic disease and radiation sensitization.\n\nCombined modality therapy, including irradiation and concurrently administered 5FU based chemotherapy, has become the mainstay of therapy for anal and rectal cancers. Protracted venous infusion chemoradiation is also used in the preoperative management of rectal cancer and in the nonoperative management of anal cancers. The Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG) has demonstrated a significant survival advantage for patients who receive adjuvant combined radiation and bolus 5FU following curative resection of pancreatic cancer (17,18). Similar advantages have been demonstrated in unresectable pancreatic cancers. Significant advantages have also been shown for concurrent chemotherapy regiments containing 5FU in esophageal cancer (19), squamous cell carcinoma of the Head and Neck (20,21), and carcinoma of the cervix (22).\n\nThere is very limited experience with the use of capecitabine and radiation. Based on its relative selectivity and the increase in tumor cell 5FU levels, it should be expected that capecitabine will provide superior radiosensitization at equivalent or reduced systemic toxicity levels. Interestingly, it has been recently reported that radiation induces thymidine phosphorylase and enhances the efficacy of capecitabine in human cancer xenografts (23). This may further enhance the synergistic effects, and consequently the therapeutic ratio.\n\nIn RTOG study a substantial number of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies treated with concurrent radiotherapy and capecitabine at a dose of 1600 mg/m2/day (5 days a week) with very little toxicity(24 ).In phase II study of chemoradiation for rectal cancer 1650mg/m2/d of capecitabine for 14 days was safe and well-tolerated treatment(25).\n\nIn this study we will investigate the feasibility of concurrent Capecitabine and external beam radiotherapy, as well as collect preliminary data regarding the efficacy of this regimen.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nHypothesis: Given the hypothesis that regimens employing greater intensity radiation yield higher rates of pain relief, radiosensitization using a tumor targeted drug like Xeloda should improve the rate of complete pain relief as compared to radiosensitization with 5FU alone.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo determine the frequency and duration of pain relief and narcotic relief for the proposed regimen.\n\nSecondary Objective:\n\nTo determine the toxicity of concurrent Capecitabine and radiotherapy in breast cancer patients with bone metastases.\n\nEligibility Criteria\n\nPatients with metastatic breast will be allowed on the study regardless of their prior exposure to chemotherapy. Today, there is no evidence to suggest crossresistance between radiotherapy and prior chemotherapy, or that response to radiotherapy is related in any way to the number of lines of chemotherapy used in a particular patient. Good palliative responses can often be achieved in heavily pretreated patients.\n\n1. The patient must be 18 years of age or older.\n2. The patient must have histologically proven breast adenocarcinoma.\n3. Radiographic evidence of bone metastasis is required .Acceptable studies include plain radiographs, radionuclide bone scans, computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n4 .The patient must have pain that appears to be related to the radiographically documented metastasis.\n\n5\\. Patients receiving systemic therapy with Capecitabine to metastatic disease (according to health basket ).\n\n6\\. Patients must have an estimated life expectancy of 3 months or greater.\n\n7\\. Patients will be eligible for treatment of multiple metastases only if these can be included in no more than two treatment sites.\n\n8\\. Signed study specific informed consent.\n\n9 Karnofsky Performance Status \\> 40.\n\n10\\. Calculated Creatinine Clearance \\> 50 ml/min\n\n11.ALT and AST no greater than 3 5 times the institutional normal; bilirubin and serum creatinine no greater than 1.5 times normal; ANC greater than 1500, and platelets at least 100,00.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n1. Prior radiation therapy or prior palliative surgery to the painful site.\n2. Impending fracture of the treatment site or planned surgical fixation of the bone.\n3. Patients with clinical or radiographic evidence of spinal cord or cauda equina compression.\n4. Patients receiving systemic radionuclides (strontium, samarium, etc.) within 60 days prior to registration.\n\n   PRETREATMENT EVALUATION\n\n1\\. Histologic diagnosis of the primary site. 2. Radiographic assessment, with must include plain x-ray of the index lesion (s) and a bone scane.\n\n3\\. Pain assessment score (BPI ). 4. Laboratory studis within 2 weeks of registration (CBC, serum ALT, AST ,total bilirubin and creatinine).\n\nRADIATION THERAPY\n\n1. Treatment must be given using 6-15MV photons or 6-18 MeV electrons .\n2. All fields must be treated each day. Treatment volume will include the radiographic abnormality with at least a 2 cm margin. Treatment of the entire bone is not required.\n3. Anterior and posterior parallel opposed fields will be used for lumbar spine, sacrum, and extremity sites. Equal weighting is recommended, although unequal weighting may be used for the lumbar or sacral spine with a ratio of doses of 1:2 AP:PA. Dose will be prescribed at mid depth at the central axis, or at the center of target volume if unequal weighting is used.\n\n   Alternatively, the lumbar spine may be treated with a single PA field, with the dose prescribed to the mid vertebral body as defined by a lateral simulator film.\n4. Single posterior fields will be used for the thoracic spine and scapula .The treatment depth is set at the middle of the vertebral body, as determined by a lateral simulation film.\n5. The cervical spine may be treated with either parallel opposed lateral fields or with a single posterior field. When lateral fields are used, the isocenter should be at mid thickness, with the dose prescribed to the mid vertebral body.\n6. Pubic. bone lesions will be treated with a single anterior field at a depth determined by lateral radiograph or CT scan.\n7. Clavicular lesions will be treated with a single anterior field at a depth of 3 cm. The dose will be prescribed to the 3 cm depth. An alternative depth may be used as determined by CT scan or other radiographs.\n8. Rib metastases may be treated with electrons or with photons. When electrons are used, the appropriate energy should be chosen such that the entire lesion is covered by the 90% (or higher) isodose curve. The dose will be prescribed to the 100% isodose line. When photons are used, parallel opposed fields may be used, with the depth prescribed to the mid thickness. Tangential fields are strongly encouraged to avoid treatment of underlying structures. A single field may be used to cover the lesion, with the depth set at the estimated depth of the rib lesion, and the dose prescribed to that level.\n9. When more than one osseous site is to be included into a treatment field, the treating radiation oncologist may use different field arrangements at herlhis discretion, with the goal of providing relatively uniform coverage of the target sites and minimum inclusion of uninvolved tissues.\n\nRadiation Dose\n\nAll patients will receive radiotherapy to a dose 30 Gy in 10fractions (3 Gy per fraction) over two weeks.\n\nCHEMOTHERAPY\n\nChemotherapy with capecitabine tablets will be given concurrently with radiotherapy in the dose 1400 mg/m2 orally, in two daily divided doses.\n\nTotal daily dose rounded to the nearest 500 mg and divided into morning and evening\n\nDoses, as per the following table:\n\nNumber of 500 mg tablets to be taken Surface Area Total Daily Dose morning evening (m2) (mg)\\* \\<= 1.08 1000 1 1 1.09 1.4 1500 2 1 1.41 1.71 2000 2 2 1.72 2.02 2500 3 2\n\n\\*Total Daily Dose rounded to the nearest 500 mg and divided into morning and evening doses.\n\nDose Limiting Toxicity\n\ni) \\>grade 3 non hematologic toxicity, except for diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, alopecia, fever and/or local reactions.\n\nii) grade 4 diarrhea lasting \\>3 days which is not controllable with loperamide or other such medications. Or grade 4 diarrhea that requires IV hydration.\n\niii) grade 4 neutropenia lasting \\>3 days\n\niv) grade 4 thrombocytopenia\n\nv) grade 2 hand foot syndrome. Dose adjustments will be as per the following table:\n\nToxicity NCI Grades During a Course of Therapy Grade 1 Maintain dose Grade 2 1st appearance (non HFS) Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1\n\n1st appearance of HFS Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 75 % of original dose.\n\n2nd appearance Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 75 % of original dose.\n\n3rd appearance Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 50 % of original dose.\n\n4th appearance Discontinue treatment permanently Grade 3\n\n1. st appearance Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 75 % of original dose with prophylaxis where possible.\n2. nd appearance Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 50 % of original dose.\n3. rd appearance Discontinue treatment permanently Grade 4\n\n1st appearance Discontinue permanently or If physician deems it to be in the patient's best interest to continue, interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 50 % of original dose .\n\nDosage modifications are not recommended for grade 1 events. Therapy with capecitabine should be interrupted upon the occurrence of a grade 2 or 3 adverse experience. Once the adverse event has resolved or decreased in intensity to grade 1, then therapy may be restarted at full dose or as adjusted according to the above table. If a grade 4 experience occurs, therapy should be discontinued or interrupted until resolved or decreased to grade 1, and therapy should be restarted at 50% of the original dose. Doses of capecitabine omitted for toxicity are not replaced or restored; instead the patient should resume the planned treatment cycles. Once the dose has been reduced it should not be increased at a later time.\n\nToxicity\n\nCAPECITABINE can induce diarrhea, sometimes severe. Patients with severe diarrhea should be carefully monitored and given fluid and electrolyte replacement if they become dehydrated. National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC grade 2 diarrhea is defined as an increase of 4 to 6 stools/day or nocturnal stools, grade 3 diarrhea as an increase of 7 to 9 stools/day or incontinence and malabsorption, and grade 4 diarrhea as an increase of \\>10 stools/day or grossly bloody diarrhea or the need for parenteral support. If grade 2, 3 or 4 diarrhea occurs, administration of capecitabine should be immediately interrupted until the diarrhea resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. Following grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, subsequent doses of capecitabine should be decreased. Standard antidiarrheal treatments (eg, loperamide) are recommended. Necrotizing enterocolitis (typhlitis) has also been reported.\n\nHand and foot syndrome (palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia or chemotherapy induced acral erythema) is characterized by the following: numbness, dysesthesia/paresthesia, tingling, painless or painful swelling, erythema, desquamation, blistering and severe pain. Grade 2 hand and foot syndrome is defined as painful erythema and swelling of the hands and/or feet and/or discomfort affecting the patient's activities of daily living. Grade 3 hand and¬foot syndrome is defined as moist desquamation, ulceration, blistering and severe pain of the hands and/or feet and/or severe discomfort that causes the patient to be unable to work or perform activities of daily living. If grade 2 or 3 hand and foot syndrome occurs, administration of capecitabine should be interrupted until the event resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. Following the occurrence of grade 2 handand foot syndrome, subsequent doses of capecitabine should be decreased.\n\nThere has been cardiotoxicity associated with fluorinated pyrimidine therapy, including myocardial infarction, angina, dysrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, sudden death and electrocardiograph changes. These adverse events may be more common in patients with a prior history of coronary artery disease.\n\nPatients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction due to liver metastases should be carefully monitored when capecitabine is administered. The effect of severe hepatic dysfunction on the disposition of capecitabine is not known. If drug related grade 2 4 elevations in bilirubin occur, administration of capecitabine should be immediately interrupted until the hyperbilirubinernia resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. NCIC grade 2 hyperbilirubinernia is defined as 1.5 x normal, grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia as 1.5 3 x normal and grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia as \\>3 x normal.\n\nIncreases in adverse events have been noted in patients with reduced renal function. Therefore, patients will be excluded for a calculated creatinine clearance of less than 50 ml/min.\n\nMyelosuppression was rare.\n\nAssessment of Response\n\nPain scores and narcotic scores will be determined using the guidelines in following table:\n\nPAIN AND NARCOTIC CATEGORIES AND SCORES PAIN ANALGESIA Severity 0 No pain 0 None I Mild I Analgesics (ASA, Bufferin, Tylenol, Anacin, etc.) 2 Moderate 2 Mild Narcotic, (\\< 112 gr. codeine, Darvon, etc.) 3 Severe 3 Moderate Narcotic (\\> 112 \\< gr. codeine, Percoan, etc) 4 Strong 4 Narcotic, (\\> 1 gr. codeine, demerol, morphine, etc) Frequency 0 None 0 None I Occasional (\\< daily) I p.r.n.

(\\> 4 tab. or cap./day)\n\nPain Score = Pain Severity Grade x Pain Frequency Grade Narcotic Score = Analgesia Severity Grade x Analgesic Frequency Grade\n\nResponse will be evaluated by questionnaires at follow up visit at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy and by phone call interviews (when necessary for completeness) in poor compliance patients.\n\nThe \"worst pain score\" will be used as response endpoint. The time to maximal pain relief is the time from the first day of irradiation to the time of the lowest pain score for average pain.\n\nResponse Definitions\n\nComplete response is defined as an average pain score of 0 for two consecutive analysis periods. Narcotic consumption must not be increased. Partial response. A decrease of at least 2 points in the worst pain score for two consecutive analysis periods. Narcotic consumption must not be increased. No response (any of the following): A pain score that does not change within 8 weeks from the start of radiation therapy.\n\nA 2 point increase in worst pain score that is sustained at a higher level in the month following the first day of radiation therapy.\n\nA pain score that drops by at least 2 points and subsequent sustained rise (on 2 successive questionnaires) of pain score by at least 2 points. Any patient with progressive pain in the treated area should have plain radiographs of the area to assess for bone stability and pathologic fracture.\n\nReferences.\n\n1\\.\n\nHoskin PJ.

It belongs to a new class of medications known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Sorafenib is thought to work against cancer in many ways. It helps decrease blood supply to the tumor. It also blocks some proteins that help the tumor cells to grow.\" Sorafenib is approved by the Food and Drug administration (FDA) for treatment for other cancers like liver and kidney cancer. Sorafenib has also been studied in the treatment of breast cancer that has spread but is not specifically approved for the treatment of breast cancer. It has been studied both as a single agent and also in combination with other anti-cancer therapies for breast cancer. In laboratory models and in some patients with other cancers, sorafenib has been studied in tumors in the brain.\n\nIn this study, sorafenib will be given together with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT).

Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or to use a highly effective methods of contraception (eg, condom + spermicide, condom + diaphragm with spermicide, intra-uterine device, or have a vasectomised partner) having started for at least one menstrual cycle prior to starting eribulin and throughout the entire treatment period and for 30 days (longer if appropriate) after the last dose of eribulin. Those women using hormonal contraceptives must also be using an additional approved method of contraception (as described previously). Perimenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential.\n\nExclusion Criteria Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in the treatment protocol:\n\n1. Eligible for any other eribulin study that is open in the same region.\n2. Existing anti-cancer therapy-related toxicities of Grade \\>/= 2, except that alopecia and Grade 2 neuropathy are acceptable.\n3.

Electrocardiogram with QTc interval \\>/= 500 msec based upon Bazett's formula (QTcB).\n5. The Investigator believes the subject to be medically unfit to receive eribulin or unsuitable for any other reason.\n6. Females who are pregnant (positive B-hCG test) or breastfeeding.\n7. Subject with hypersensitivity to eribulin or any of the excipients.\n8. Subjects with brain or subdural metastases are not eligible, unless they have completed local therapy and have discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this indication for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment in this treatment protocol. Any signs (eg, radiologic) and/or symptoms of brain metastases must be stable for at least 4 weeks before starting the treatment protocol.\n9. Any history of or concomitant medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the subject's ability to safely complete the treatment protocol.\n10. Subjects who are known to be human immunodeficiency virus positive because the neutropenia caused by the eribulin treatment may make such subjects particularly susceptible to infection.\n11. Subjects with meningeal carcinomatosis.\n12. Pulmonary lymphangitic involvement that results in pulmonary dysfunction requiring active treatment, including the use of oxygen.\n13. Subjects who have received any of the following treatments within the specified period before the start of treatment:\n\n    * Any investigational drug, chemotherapy, radiation, or biological or targeted therapy within 2 weeks.\n    * Hormonal therapy within 1 week.", "healthyVolunteers": false, "sex": "FEMALE", "minimumAge": "18 Years", "stdAges": ["ADULT", "OLDER_ADULT"]},

Eligible for any other eribulin study that is open in the same region.\n2. Existing anti-cancer therapy-related toxicities of Grade \\>/= 2, except that alopecia and Grade 2 neuropathy are acceptable.\n3. History of congestive heart failure with New York Heart Association Classification \\>II, unstable angina, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, serious cardiac arrhythmia.\n4. Electrocardiogram with QTc interval \\>/= 500 msec based upon Bazett's formula (QTcB).\n5. The Investigator believes the subject to be medically unfit to receive eribulin or unsuitable for any other reason.\n6. Females who are pregnant (positive B-hCG test) or breastfeeding.\n7. Subject with hypersensitivity to eribulin or any of the excipients.\n8. Subjects with brain or subdural metastases are not eligible, unless they have completed local therapy and have discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this indication for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment in this treatment protocol. Any signs (eg, radiologic) and/or symptoms of brain metastases must be stable for at least 4 weeks before starting the treatment protocol.\n9. Any history of or concomitant medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the subject's ability to safely complete the treatment protocol.\n10. Subjects who are known to be human immunodeficiency virus positive because the neutropenia caused by the eribulin treatment may make such subjects particularly susceptible to infection.\n11. Subjects with meningeal carcinomatosis.\n12. Pulmonary lymphangitic involvement that results in pulmonary dysfunction requiring active treatment, including the use of oxygen.\n13. Subjects who have received any of the following treatments within the specified period before the start of treatment:\n\n    * Any investigational drug, chemotherapy, radiation, or biological or targeted therapy within 2 weeks.\n    * Hormonal therapy within 1 week.", "healthyVolunteers": false, "sex": "FEMALE", "minimumAge": "18 Years", "stdAges": ["ADULT", "OLDER_ADULT"]},

In the nineties, the sentinel lymph node procedure, which involves the selective removal of the first few affected lymph nodes, was introduced in clinical practice. Today, conventional axillary dissection is still performed on many women with breast cancer that has spread to the nodes. It is the cause for relevant morbidity in the form of lymphedema, impairment of shoulder mobility, sensation disorders and chronic pain in as much as one third of all women undergoing the procedure.\n\nThe TAXIS trial will evaluate the optimal treatment for breast cancer patients in terms of surgery and radiotherapy. In particular, it will investigate the value of tailored axillary surgery (TAS), a new technique that aims at selectively removing the positive lymph nodes. TAS combines the removal of palpably suspicious nodes with the sentinel procedure. TAS is a promising procedure that may significantly decrease morbidity in breast cancer patients by avoiding surgical overtreatment.\n\nThis trial has the potential to establish a new worldwide treatment standard with hopefully less side effects and a better quality of life, while keeping the same efficacy as provided by radical surgery.\n\nThe main objective of the trial is to show that TAS and axillary radiotherapy (RT) is non-inferior to ALND in terms of disease-free survival of node positive breast cancer patients at high risk of recurrence in the era of effective systemic therapy and extended regional nodal irradiation."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Node-positive Breast Cancer"], "keywords": ["Tailored Axillary Surgery", "TAXIS", "Breast Cancer", "node-positive breast cancer", "phase III trial", "IBCSG 57-18", "ABCSG"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 1500, "type": "ESTIMATED"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "ALND", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Tailored axillary surgery followed by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and regional nodal irradiation excluding the dissected axilla.", "interventionNames": ["Procedure: Tailored axillary surgery - both Arms", "Radiation: Radiotherapy - Arm A"]}, {"label": "No ALND", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "Tailored axillary surgery followed by regional nodal irradiation including the full axilla.", "interventionNames": ["Procedure: Tailored axillary surgery - both Arms", "Radiation: Radiotherapy - Arm B"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "PROCEDURE", "name": "Tailored axillary surgery - both Arms", "description": "Axillary lymph node dissection - Arm A", "armGroupLabels": ["ALND", "No ALND"]}, {"type": "RADIATION", "name": "Radiotherapy - Arm A", "description": "Regional nodal irradiation excluding the dissected axilla - Arm A", "armGroupLabels": ["ALND"]}, {"type": "RADIATION", "name": "Radiotherapy - Arm B", "description": "Regional nodal irradiation including the full axilla - Arm B", "armGroupLabels": ["No ALND"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Disease-free survival (DFS)", "description": "The primary endpoint of this trial is DFS, defined as time from randomization until one of the following events, whichever comes first:\n\n* Local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant recurrence\n* Second breast cancer\n* Death from any cause Patients not experiencing an event will be censored at the date of the last available assessment.", "timeFrame": "at the occurrence of the event or latest 20 years after randomization of the last patient"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Overall survival (OS)", "description": "OS will be calculated from randomization until death from any cause.

Normal cardiac function: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥50% (any assessment method).\n11. Measured Creatinine clearance (Cockcroft and Gault) ≥40 mL/min OR creatinine ≤1.5 times ULN.\n12. Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for female pre-menopausal patients (urine within 72 hours, or serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to enrolment).\n13. Patient willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including: treatment and scheduled visits during the treatment phase, and visits during follow up.\n14. Patient is willing to comply with a baseline tumour biopsy (unless an archived biopsy of a secondary or a primary site of the current disease-collected within 3 months prior enrolment is available for research ; bone metastasis are accepted only when predominant extra-bone tissue is available), and with a series of blood samples throughout the study.\n15. Patient must be affiliated to a social health insurance.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Other concurrent malignancies, except adequately treated cone-biopsied in situ carcinoma of the cervix, or basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Patients who have had potentially curative therapy for a prior malignancy are eligible provided there has been no evidence of disease for ≥5 years and the risk of recurrence is considered low.\n2. Active brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or leptomeningeal disease. Patients whose brain metastases have been treated may participate if the brain metastases are stable by imagery (defined as 2 brain images, both obtained after treatment of the brain metastases and at least four weeks apart, and showing no evidence of intracranial progression). In addition, any neurologic symptoms caused by the brain metastases or their treatment must be resolved or stable, without steroidal treatment or with a dose of steroid ≤10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent and an anticonvulsants, for at least 14 days prior to the start of treatment.\n3. Previous treatment with an anti-PD1/PD-L1 including durvalumab or an anti-CTLA-4 therapy including tremelimumab or vinorelbine.\n4. Patients with known allergy or severe hypersensitivity to any of the study treatments or any of the study treatment excipients.\n5. History of active primary immunodeficiency.\n6.

History of allogeneic organ transplantation.\n8. History or evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.\n9. Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis testing in line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) result), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies). Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA.\n10. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab. The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\n    * Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra articular injection)\n    * Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses ≤10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent\n    * Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan premedication)\n11.

In this setting ,the emphasis is on alleviation of symptoms and preservation or improvement of quality of life. A large body of clinical evidence documents the effectiveness of local-field external beam radiotherapy in palliation of pain from osseous metastases (1). Despite this general agreement, controversy remains regarding the optimal dose and fractionation schedule. Prospective phase III clinical trials (2-6), today, have failed to demonstrate superiority of one schedule over another ,and as a result, the patterns of practice of remain diverse in duration and intensity.\n\nBetween 1974 and 1980 the RTOG conducted a large national study to determine the effectiveness of five different dose fractionation schedules(2). A total of 1016 patients were entered ,266 into a \"solitary metastasis\" stratum, and 750 into a \"multiple metastasis \" stratum. The former were randomly assigned to treatment with 40,5Gy in 15 fractions or 20Gy in 5 fractions. The latter were assigned to 30Gy in 10 fractions, 15 Gy in5 fractions ,20 Gy in 5 fractions, or 25 Gy in 5 fractions. A quantitative measure of pain ,based on severity and frequency of pain, and the type and frequency of pain medications used, was devised to evaluate response. Overall, 89% of patients experienced minimal relief. There were no significant difference between the treatment arms in both strata. The initial pain score was found to be a useful predictor ; patients with high score were less likely to respond and were less likely to experience a complete response. Patients with breast and prostate cancer were significantly more likely to respond than patients with lung or other primary lesions. Patients completing their treatment as planned had significantly higher rates of complete response than those who did not .While some relief was experienced almost invariably within the first four weeks, complete relief was first reported later than four weeks after start of treatment in about 50 % of patients .The median duration of minimal and complete pain relief was 20 and 12 weeks ,respectively. There were no significant differences in duration of pain relief between the different arms It was concluded that all treatment dose schedules were equally effective.\n\nA reanalysis of the RTOG study was reported by Blitzer (7).Using a stepwise logistic regression, he examined the effect of the number of fractions, the dose per fraction, and solitary versus multiple metastases, on the probability of attaining complete pain relief and the need for retreatment. This multivariate technique allowed patients with solitary and multiple metastases to be analyzed together. By increasing the number of subjects and events the statistical power of the analysis was outcome. There was no correlation of the time dose factor with outcome (8). It was concluded that the more protracted schedules resulted in improved pain relief.\n\nPrice et al. randomized 288 patients to receive either 8 Gy in one fraction or 30 Gy in 10 daily fractions. Pain was assessed using a questionnaire completed by the patients at the home on a daily basis. No differences were found in the probability of attaining pain relief, the speed of onset or the duration of relief between the two arms(4). Hoskin et al. randomized 270 patients to receive either 4 Gy or 8 Gy in one fraction (3) Pain assessed by the patient) and analgesic usage were recorded before treatment and at 2,4,8 and 12 weeks. At 4 weeks the response rates were 69% for 8 Gy and 44% for 4 Gy (p\\<0.001). The duration of the effect was independent of dose.\n\nTwo other randomized trials have been reported (5,6). Given the small difference in the Biological Effective Dose ( BED) between the arms (6) and the small number of patients accrued (5,6), it is not surprising that no differences between the treatment arms were detected.\n\nRTOG have reported the results of a pooled data dose response analysis (11). A computerized literature search was conducted to identify prospectively randomized clinical studies which addressed this issue and the results of these studies (2 6) were pooled together to form a database for analysis. The endpoint selected for analysis was complete response (CR). It was felt that this endpoint was most likely to be evaluated in a consistent fashion by different investigators. One study (6) was excluded from the analysis because outcome was not reported using conventional definitions of complete and partial response. To allow comparison of the different study arms, the BED was calculated for each schedule. Odds ratios calculated for various dose levels showed a statistically significant increase from 1.00 to 3.32 as the BED increased from 14.4 Gy to 5 1.4 Gy.\n\nFor the first time, RTOG analysis demonstrated a highly significant dose response relationship for palliation of pain from bone metastases with radiotherapy. Furthermore, there was no evidence of flattening of the dose¬-response curve within the dose range tested, suggesting that further gains can be realized at doses outside of the range tested. We propose a phase II clinical trial in which the biological effective dose will be increased by the concurrent use of a radiosensitizer. The main advantage of this approach over escalation of the physical dose is the avoidance of increase in the overall treatment time.\n\nCapecitabine is a fluoropyrimidine carbamate with antineoplastic activity. It is an orally administered systemic prodrug of 5' deoxy 5 fluorouridine (5' DFUR) which is converted to 5 Capecitabine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In the liver, a 60 kDa carboxyesterase hydrolyzes much of the compound to 5' deoxy 5 fluorocytidine (5' DFCR). Cytidine deaminase, an enzyme found in most tissues, including tumors, subsequently converts 5' DFCR to 5' deoxy 5 fluorouridine (5' DFUR).. The enzyme, thymidine phosphorylase (dThdPase), then hydrolyzes 5' DFUR to the active drug 5 FU. Many tissues throughout the body express thymidine phosphorylase. Some human carcinomas express this enzyme in higher concentrations than surrounding normal tissues. Both normal and tumor cells metabolize 5 FU to 5¬fluoro 2 deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5 fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP). These metabolites cause cell injury by two different mechanisms. First, HUMP and the folate cofactor, N5 10¬methylenetetrahydrofolate, bind to thymidylate synthase (TS) to form a covalently bound ternary complex. This binding inhibits the formation of thymidylate from uracil. Thymidylate is the necessary precursor of thymidine triphosphate, which is essential for the synthesis of DNA, so that a deficiency of this compound can inhibit cell division. Second, nuclear transcriptional enzymes can mistakenly incorporate FUTP in place of uridine triphosphate (UTP) during the synthesis of RNA. This metabolic error can interfere with RNA processing and protein synthesis. Capecitabine is already approved for use in patients with metastatic breast cancer resistant to both paclitaxel and an anthracycline containing chemotherapy regimen.\n\nAlthough 5FU is an established radiosensitizer, the exact mechanism by which it enhances cell kill is not well understood. Sensitization is schedule dependent and is maximal when a cytocidal concentration of 5FU is given after the radiation exposure (12). The effect does not result from increased sublethal damage or inhibition of sublethal damage repair (12,13). Current evidence suggests that radiosensitization by 5FU is mediated through its effects on DNA rather then RNA (14). In vivo (15) as well as clinical studies (16) have demonstrated the superiority of continuous over bolus infusion of 5FU.\n\nOver the last several decades, concurrent 5FU and radiation have been used successfully in a variety of malignancies. Several important lessons have been learned from clinical trials (16). Simultaneous delivery of large (IV bolus) doses of 5 fluorouracil with irradiation is associated with improved survival compared to treatment with radiation alone, but at a price of increased normal tissue toxicity. These side effects can be ameliorated by using protracted venous infusion. This is an efficacious approach, with a wide therapeutic index, which permits concurrent treatment of micrometastatic disease and radiation sensitization.\n\nCombined modality therapy, including irradiation and concurrently administered 5FU based chemotherapy, has become the mainstay of therapy for anal and rectal cancers. Protracted venous infusion chemoradiation is also used in the preoperative management of rectal cancer and in the nonoperative management of anal cancers. The Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG) has demonstrated a significant survival advantage for patients who receive adjuvant combined radiation and bolus 5FU following curative resection of pancreatic cancer (17,18). Similar advantages have been demonstrated in unresectable pancreatic cancers. Significant advantages have also been shown for concurrent chemotherapy regiments containing 5FU in esophageal cancer (19), squamous cell carcinoma of the Head and Neck (20,21), and carcinoma of the cervix (22).\n\nThere is very limited experience with the use of capecitabine and radiation. Based on its relative selectivity and the increase in tumor cell 5FU levels, it should be expected that capecitabine will provide superior radiosensitization at equivalent or reduced systemic toxicity levels. Interestingly, it has been recently reported that radiation induces thymidine phosphorylase and enhances the efficacy of capecitabine in human cancer xenografts (23). This may further enhance the synergistic effects, and consequently the therapeutic ratio.\n\nIn RTOG study a substantial number of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies treated with concurrent radiotherapy and capecitabine at a dose of 1600 mg/m2/day (5 days a week) with very little toxicity(24 ).In phase II study of chemoradiation for rectal cancer 1650mg/m2/d of capecitabine for 14 days was safe and well-tolerated treatment(25).\n\nIn this study we will investigate the feasibility of concurrent Capecitabine and external beam radiotherapy, as well as collect preliminary data regarding the efficacy of this regimen.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nHypothesis: Given the hypothesis that regimens employing greater intensity radiation yield higher rates of pain relief, radiosensitization using a tumor targeted drug like Xeloda should improve the rate of complete pain relief as compared to radiosensitization with 5FU alone.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo determine the frequency and duration of pain relief and narcotic relief for the proposed regimen.\n\nSecondary Objective:\n\nTo determine the toxicity of concurrent Capecitabine and radiotherapy in breast cancer patients with bone metastases.\n\nEligibility Criteria\n\nPatients with metastatic breast will be allowed on the study regardless of their prior exposure to chemotherapy. Today, there is no evidence to suggest crossresistance between radiotherapy and prior chemotherapy, or that response to radiotherapy is related in any way to the number of lines of chemotherapy used in a particular patient. Good palliative responses can often be achieved in heavily pretreated patients.\n\n1. The patient must be 18 years of age or older.\n2. The patient must have histologically proven breast adenocarcinoma.\n3. Radiographic evidence of bone metastasis is required .Acceptable studies include plain radiographs, radionuclide bone scans, computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n4 .The patient must have pain that appears to be related to the radiographically documented metastasis.\n\n5\\. Patients receiving systemic therapy with Capecitabine to metastatic disease (according to health basket ).\n\n6\\. Patients must have an estimated life expectancy of 3 months or greater.\n\n7\\. Patients will be eligible for treatment of multiple metastases only if these can be included in no more than two treatment sites.\n\n8\\. Signed study specific informed consent.\n\n9 Karnofsky Performance Status \\> 40.\n\n10\\. Calculated Creatinine Clearance \\> 50 ml/min\n\n11.ALT and AST no greater than 3 5 times the institutional normal; bilirubin and serum creatinine no greater than 1.5 times normal; ANC greater than 1500, and platelets at least 100,00.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n1. Prior radiation therapy or prior palliative surgery to the painful site.\n2. Impending fracture of the treatment site or planned surgical fixation of the bone.\n3. Patients with clinical or radiographic evidence of spinal cord or cauda equina compression.\n4. Patients receiving systemic radionuclides (strontium, samarium, etc.) within 60 days prior to registration.\n\n   PRETREATMENT EVALUATION\n\n1\\. Histologic diagnosis of the primary site. 2. Radiographic assessment, with must include plain x-ray of the index lesion (s) and a bone scane.\n\n3\\. Pain assessment score (BPI ). 4. Laboratory studis within 2 weeks of registration (CBC, serum ALT, AST ,total bilirubin and creatinine).\n\nRADIATION THERAPY\n\n1. Treatment must be given using 6-15MV photons or 6-18 MeV electrons .\n2. All fields must be treated each day. Treatment volume will include the radiographic abnormality with at least a 2 cm margin. Treatment of the entire bone is not required.\n3. Anterior and posterior parallel opposed fields will be used for lumbar spine, sacrum, and extremity sites. Equal weighting is recommended, although unequal weighting may be used for the lumbar or sacral spine with a ratio of doses of 1:2 AP:PA. Dose will be prescribed at mid depth at the central axis, or at the center of target volume if unequal weighting is used.\n\n   Alternatively, the lumbar spine may be treated with a single PA field, with the dose prescribed to the mid vertebral body as defined by a lateral simulator film.\n4. Single posterior fields will be used for the thoracic spine and scapula .The treatment depth is set at the middle of the vertebral body, as determined by a lateral simulation film.\n5. The cervical spine may be treated with either parallel opposed lateral fields or with a single posterior field. When lateral fields are used, the isocenter should be at mid thickness, with the dose prescribed to the mid vertebral body.\n6. Pubic. bone lesions will be treated with a single anterior field at a depth determined by lateral radiograph or CT scan.\n7. Clavicular lesions will be treated with a single anterior field at a depth of 3 cm. The dose will be prescribed to the 3 cm depth. An alternative depth may be used as determined by CT scan or other radiographs.\n8. Rib metastases may be treated with electrons or with photons. When electrons are used, the appropriate energy should be chosen such that the entire lesion is covered by the 90% (or higher) isodose curve. The dose will be prescribed to the 100% isodose line. When photons are used, parallel opposed fields may be used, with the depth prescribed to the mid thickness. Tangential fields are strongly encouraged to avoid treatment of underlying structures. A single field may be used to cover the lesion, with the depth set at the estimated depth of the rib lesion, and the dose prescribed to that level.\n9. When more than one osseous site is to be included into a treatment field, the treating radiation oncologist may use different field arrangements at herlhis discretion, with the goal of providing relatively uniform coverage of the target sites and minimum inclusion of uninvolved tissues.\n\nRadiation Dose\n\nAll patients will receive radiotherapy to a dose 30 Gy in 10fractions (3 Gy per fraction) over two weeks.\n\nCHEMOTHERAPY\n\nChemotherapy with capecitabine tablets will be given concurrently with radiotherapy in the dose 1400 mg/m2 orally, in two daily divided doses.\n\nTotal daily dose rounded to the nearest 500 mg and divided into morning and evening\n\nDoses, as per the following table:\n\nNumber of 500 mg tablets to be taken Surface Area Total Daily Dose morning evening (m2) (mg)\\* \\<= 1.08 1000 1 1 1.09 1.4 1500 2 1 1.41 1.71 2000 2 2 1.72 2.02 2500 3 2\n\n\\*Total Daily Dose rounded to the nearest 500 mg and divided into morning and evening doses.\n\nDose Limiting Toxicity\n\ni) \\>grade 3 non hematologic toxicity, except for diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, alopecia, fever and/or local reactions.\n\nii) grade 4 diarrhea lasting \\>3 days which is not controllable with loperamide or other such medications.

Dose adjustments will be as per the following table:\n\nToxicity NCI Grades During a Course of Therapy Grade 1 Maintain dose Grade 2 1st appearance (non HFS) Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1\n\n1st appearance of HFS Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 75 % of original dose.\n\n2nd appearance Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 75 % of original dose.\n\n3rd appearance Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 50 % of original dose.\n\n4th appearance Discontinue treatment permanently Grade 3\n\n1. st appearance Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 75 % of original dose with prophylaxis where possible.\n2. nd appearance Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 50 % of original dose.\n3. rd appearance Discontinue treatment permanently Grade 4\n\n1st appearance Discontinue permanently or If physician deems it to be in the patient's best interest to continue, interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 50 % of original dose .\n\nDosage modifications are not recommended for grade 1 events. Therapy with capecitabine should be interrupted upon the occurrence of a grade 2 or 3 adverse experience. Once the adverse event has resolved or decreased in intensity to grade 1, then therapy may be restarted at full dose or as adjusted according to the above table. If a grade 4 experience occurs, therapy should be discontinued or interrupted until resolved or decreased to grade 1, and therapy should be restarted at 50% of the original dose. Doses of capecitabine omitted for toxicity are not replaced or restored; instead the patient should resume the planned treatment cycles. Once the dose has been reduced it should not be increased at a later time.\n\nToxicity\n\nCAPECITABINE can induce diarrhea, sometimes severe. Patients with severe diarrhea should be carefully monitored and given fluid and electrolyte replacement if they become dehydrated. National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC grade 2 diarrhea is defined as an increase of 4 to 6 stools/day or nocturnal stools, grade 3 diarrhea as an increase of 7 to 9 stools/day or incontinence and malabsorption, and grade 4 diarrhea as an increase of \\>10 stools/day or grossly bloody diarrhea or the need for parenteral support. If grade 2, 3 or 4 diarrhea occurs, administration of capecitabine should be immediately interrupted until the diarrhea resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. Following grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, subsequent doses of capecitabine should be decreased. Standard antidiarrheal treatments (eg, loperamide) are recommended. Necrotizing enterocolitis (typhlitis) has also been reported.\n\nHand and foot syndrome (palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia or chemotherapy induced acral erythema) is characterized by the following: numbness, dysesthesia/paresthesia, tingling, painless or painful swelling, erythema, desquamation, blistering and severe pain. Grade 2 hand and foot syndrome is defined as painful erythema and swelling of the hands and/or feet and/or discomfort affecting the patient's activities of daily living. Grade 3 hand and¬foot syndrome is defined as moist desquamation, ulceration, blistering and severe pain of the hands and/or feet and/or severe discomfort that causes the patient to be unable to work or perform activities of daily living. If grade 2 or 3 hand and foot syndrome occurs, administration of capecitabine should be interrupted until the event resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. Following the occurrence of grade 2 handand foot syndrome, subsequent doses of capecitabine should be decreased.\n\nThere has been cardiotoxicity associated with fluorinated pyrimidine therapy, including myocardial infarction, angina, dysrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, sudden death and electrocardiograph changes. These adverse events may be more common in patients with a prior history of coronary artery disease.\n\nPatients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction due to liver metastases should be carefully monitored when capecitabine is administered. The effect of severe hepatic dysfunction on the disposition of capecitabine is not known. If drug related grade 2 4 elevations in bilirubin occur, administration of capecitabine should be immediately interrupted until the hyperbilirubinernia resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. NCIC grade 2 hyperbilirubinernia is defined as 1.5 x normal, grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia as 1.5 3 x normal and grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia as \\>3 x normal.\n\nIncreases in adverse events have been noted in patients with reduced renal function. Therefore, patients will be excluded for a calculated creatinine clearance of less than 50 ml/min.\n\nMyelosuppression was rare.\n\nAssessment of Response\n\nPain scores and narcotic scores will be determined using the guidelines in following table:\n\nPAIN AND NARCOTIC CATEGORIES AND SCORES PAIN ANALGESIA Severity 0 No pain 0 None I Mild I Analgesics (ASA, Bufferin, Tylenol, Anacin, etc.) 2 Moderate 2 Mild Narcotic, (\\< 112 gr. codeine, Darvon, etc.) 3 Severe 3 Moderate Narcotic (\\> 112 \\< gr. codeine, Percoan, etc) 4 Strong 4 Narcotic, (\\> 1 gr. codeine, demerol, morphine, etc) Frequency 0 None 0 None I Occasional (\\< daily) I p.r.n.

(\\> 4 tab. or cap./day)\n\nPain Score = Pain Severity Grade x Pain Frequency Grade Narcotic Score = Analgesia Severity Grade x Analgesic Frequency Grade\n\nResponse will be evaluated by questionnaires at follow up visit at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy and by phone call interviews (when necessary for completeness) in poor compliance patients.\n\nThe \"worst pain score\" will be used as response endpoint. The time to maximal pain relief is the time from the first day of irradiation to the time of the lowest pain score for average pain.\n\nResponse Definitions\n\nComplete response is defined as an average pain score of 0 for two consecutive analysis periods. Narcotic consumption must not be increased. Partial response. A decrease of at least 2 points in the worst pain score for two consecutive analysis periods. Narcotic consumption must not be increased. No response (any of the following): A pain score that does not change within 8 weeks from the start of radiation therapy.\n\nA 2 point increase in worst pain score that is sustained at a higher level in the month following the first day of radiation therapy.\n\nA pain score that drops by at least 2 points and subsequent sustained rise (on 2 successive questionnaires) of pain score by at least 2 points. Any patient with progressive pain in the treated area should have plain radiographs of the area to assess for bone stability and pathologic fracture.\n\nReferences.\n\n1\\.\n\nHoskin PJ.

There are effective treatments for breast cancer patients experiencing distress, such as individual or group therapy, health education, and medication. Unfortunately, clinicians may not be aware of the symptoms of distress in their breast cancer patients, and some breast cancer patients who could benefit from referral to behavioral health specialists are overlooked. New guidelines recommend that all cancer patients be regularly screened for distress. However, there are unanswered questions about the impact of distress screening conducted on a large scale. Few studies have evaluated the impact of distress screening on important outcomes in breast cancer patients, such as patient experience and use of health care services, as compared to the usual care offered by the health care organization. In addition, oncology clinicians may be uncertain about the benefits of large-scale distress screening, and pilot screening programs have not been uniformly successful particularly in the community oncology setting.\n\nThe overarching goals of this study are to assess the effectiveness of implementing a guideline-recommended distress screening program for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients on improving identification and referral to treatment for highly distressed breast cancer patients, to assess patient-reported outcomes, health services utilization, and implementation outcomes of the program. This study will address two main research questions: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of a guideline-recommended distress screening program for breast cancer patients in improving identification of distressed patients, initiation and completion of referrals to behavioral health, and patient-reported and utilization outcomes as compared to usual care; 2) Identify the barriers, facilitators, and other implementation-related outcomes related to distress screening in the community oncology setting.\n\nPlease note: This study did not require a DSMB, as it falls under the exception for low-risk behavioral studies.", "detailedDescription": "Background and Study Aims:\n\nBreast cancer patients are at risk for physical and psychosocial harms. Among the most highly prevalent psychosocial issues in breast cancer patients is psychological distress. Distress is defined and assessed as psychiatric morbidity or prevalence of psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety and depression. It is estimated that 40-50% of women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer will experience distress in the year following diagnosis. There is a rich literature on the persistent negative effects of distress in breast cancer patients, including associations with decreased physical and social functioning, increased symptom burden, higher utilization of inpatient and emergency services, and poor quality of life. Psychological distress can also adversely affect individual work productivity, and contributes to the rising costs of cancer care.\n\nRecent guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and others recommend routine distress screening for breast cancer patients, recognizing the availability of effective treatments for psychological distress. Unfortunately distress remains under-detected and undertreated in breast cancer patients and rates of adherence to ASCO and other guidelines is very low. Low rates of screening might be explained in part by limited evidence of effectiveness: while efficacy of distress screening has been demonstrated in small-scale trials at academic centers, typically showing increases in number of referrals to psychosocial services, evidence supporting the effectiveness of large scale distress screening programs under routine practice conditions is limited. It is currently unknown if distress screening of breast cancer patients will improve identification of distressed patients or referrals to behavioral health services in non-academic settings. In addition, extant efficacy studies generally fail to measure key impacts and outcomes desired from distress screening, such as patient-reported outcomes (e.g., distress management, satisfaction) and changes in health care utilization (e.g., changes in emergency department use). Implementation-related factors and outcomes have also been largely overlooked in prior research (e.g., clinician acceptability, fidelity of delivery), leaving serious gaps in the understanding of barriers to adoption of distress screening programs and gaps in the knowledge needed to facilitate large-scale, routine implementation of screening.\n\nThe overarching goal of this study is to implement and evaluate a guideline-based distress screening program for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, measuring its effectiveness and impacts on key outcomes and examining barriers and facilitators to routine adoption. There is a critical need for translational research to assess the effectiveness of distress screening programs in improving (a) identification of distress, (b) referral for services, (c) outcomes for breast cancer patients in real-world oncology settings, and in understanding implementation barriers and facilitators. Without evidence of effectiveness, it is unlikely that clinical and operational health system leaders will invest in distress screening programs, potentially leading to serious adverse consequences. This proposed translational research is crucial in order to bridge the gap between academic studies and non-academic, community oncology practice, where the majority of breast cancer patients are treated. In addition, gaining insight and understanding into barriers and facilitators to implementation of distress screening programs is critically important. The objectives are to assess the effectiveness of the recommended screening program from the joint task force of the American Psychosocial Oncology Society, Association of Oncology Social Work, and Oncology Nursing Society on improving identification and referral to treatment for highly distressed breast cancer patients within an integrated health care system, and to assess patient-reported outcomes, health services utilization, and implementation outcomes of the program.\n\nSpecific Aims:\n\nAim 1: Evaluate the effectiveness of a guideline-recommended distress screening program for breast cancer patients in improving identification of distressed patients, initiation and completion of referrals to behavioral health, and patient-reported and utilization outcomes as compared to usual care within Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), using a pragmatic cluster randomized control trial design at six medical centers.\n\nAim 2: Identify patient-, clinician-, and system-level barriers and facilitators to implementation of the program, and assess stakeholder-perceived acceptability, fidelity, and achievements of the program.\n\nStudy Methods The setting for this research is Kaiser Permanente Southern California, a large, integrated health care system with 14 medical centers serving a highly diverse population of over 4 million members. The investigators will use a novel hybrid effectiveness-implementation study design that allows for dual study of the clinical effectiveness and implementation-related factors to address the need for evidence in both areas. This study will employ mixed methods, collecting both qualitative and quantitative data as appropriate to address the study aims. To evaluate effectiveness, this study will use a cluster randomized control trial (RCT) design, clustered at the medical center level, and will implement the program at the intervention sites and offering screening to all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. To evaluate the effectiveness of the program, the investigators will collect structured data from the KPSC electronic record (referral initiation/completion, use of health services) and patient-reported data (functioning, symptom management). Existing work from a pilot primary care-based distress screening program will be leveraged for this research, demonstrating the feasibility of this study. Implementation outcomes will be assessed with qualitative and survey data.\n\nKnowledge gained from this research will be used to inform the continued development and implementation of systematic distress screening programs for breast cancer patients, and will enrich the evidence base by providing critical information on relevant patient- and system-level outcomes. These results will have an impact on the quality of life and quality of care for these patients, and will directly influence distress screening program adoption, scale-up, and spread, making this work highly relevant to breast cancer patients throughout California and across the nation."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Breast Cancer"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "OBSERVATIONAL", "patientRegistry": false, "designInfo": {"observationalModel": "OTHER", "timePerspective": "PROSPECTIVE"}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 1436, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Intervention", "description": "Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients will be offered a brief distress screening questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), around the time of their breast cancer diagnosis and again at subsequent transitions in care as appropriate (e.g., the initiation of chemotherapy).", "interventionNames": ["Behavioral: Distress screening"]}, {"label": "Control", "description": "Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients will experience usual care."}], "interventions": [{"type": "BEHAVIORAL", "name": "Distress screening", "description": "A brief depression and anxiety screening instrument, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), will be administered to newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in the Distress Screening arm.", "armGroupLabels": ["Intervention"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Number of Participants Offered and Screened for Distress", "description": "\\# of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients offered and screened with the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 at their initial consult", "timeFrame": "Patients assessed during initial consult - e.g. 1 day during 60 min consult"}, {"measure": "Number of Participants Offered an Appropriate Referral", "description": "For patients who had screening done in Oncology, appropriate action for those with a medium/high PHQ-9 is a referral to social work, psychiatry, depression care management.", "timeFrame": "Patients assessed during initial consult - e.g. 1 day during 60 min consult"}], "secondaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, Breast Cancer (FACT-B)", "description": "Self-reported for physical well-being; social family well-being; emotional well-being; functional well-being; and additional concerns over the past 7 days; scale: 0=not at all; 1=a little bit; 2=somewhat; 3=quite a bit; 4=very much; responses indicate symptoms/concerns in the past 7 days.

In partnership with Penn Medicine (Penn) and Case Western Reserve University-University Hospitals (UH), two complementary, concurrent, 6-month, cluster-randomized, pragmatic trials will be conducted.

While strong USPSTF guideline recommendations support appropriate screening for early detection and to avoid preventable deaths, breast cancer screening is often underutilized. Increasing breast cancer screening rates is challenging, in part, because it requires complementary decisions from clinicians (e.g., recommend and counsel patients about screening) and patients (e.g., to internalize risks and choose to complete screening). Presently, the lack of interventions directly targeting both clinicians' and patients' decision-making may underscore the relatively stagnant screening rates in the United States. There is a significant need to develop and scale low-cost interventions that increase breast cancer screening while simultaneously addressing the needs of high-risk patients and reducing disparities. Building upon prior work, the investigators propose to develop and test EHR-based clinician and patient nudges, with an additional intensified nudge to high-risk patients, to help increase screening mammography rates.\n\nThis study consists of two complementary and concurrent, cluster-randomized, pragmatic trials to be conducted at Penn and UH."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Breast Cancer"], "keywords": ["Screening", "Mammogram", "Behavioral Economics", "Prevention"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["NA"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "interventionModelDescription": "For the Penn trial, primary care clinics will be randomized 2:1 to the intervention arm or control arm using covariate-constrained randomization.
