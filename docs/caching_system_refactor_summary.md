# Caching System Refactor Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring of the caching system to create a unified API manager that handles caching for both benchmarks and fetcher components.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Unified API Manager

- Created `src/utils/api_manager.py` with `UnifiedAPIManager` and `APICache` classes
- The `UnifiedAPIManager` provides a centralized interface for managing all API caching
- The `APICache` class is now more generic and supports namespaces for different types of cached data

### 2. Updated Benchmark System

- Modified `src/pipeline/strict_llm_base.py` to use the new `UnifiedAPIManager`
- Replaced direct `APICache` instantiation with `UnifiedAPIManager` usage
- Maintained the same caching interface to minimize disruption

### 3. Updated Fetcher System

- Modified `src/pipeline/fetcher.py` to use the new `UnifiedAPIManager`
- Replaced `@cache_api_response` decorator usage with direct cache calls
- Preserved existing TTL values for each function

### 4. Updated Demo Files

- Updated `examples/demo/demo_llm_caching.py` to use the new unified caching approach
- Updated `examples/demo/demo_cache_functionality.py` to use the new unified caching approach

### 5. Updated Test Files

- Updated `tests/unit/src/optimization/test_llm_caching.py` to use the new unified caching approach
- Updated `tests/unit/src/optimization/test_cache_implementation.py` to use the new unified caching approach
- Updated `tests/unit/src/optimization/test_prompt_benchmarks_across_models.py` to use the new unified caching approach
- Updated `tests/unit/src/optimization/test_llm_cache_detailed.py` to use the new unified caching approach
- Updated `tests/unit/src/optimization/test_benchmark_caching_issue.py` to use the new unified caching approach

### 6. Removed Stale/Legacy Code

- Removed all imports and usage of the old `src/utils/cache_decorator.py` module
- The old caching implementation is no longer referenced by any active code

## Testing Recommendations

To verify that the new caching system works correctly, the following tests should be run:

### 1. Unit Tests

- Run `tests/unit/src/optimization/test_llm_caching.py`
- Run `tests/unit/src/optimization/test_cache_implementation.py`
- Run `tests/unit/src/optimization/test_prompt_benchmarks_across_models.py`
- Run `tests/unit/src/optimization/test_llm_cache_detailed.py`
- Run `tests/unit/src/optimization/test_benchmark_caching_issue.py`

### 2. Integration Tests

- Run `examples/demo/demo_llm_caching.py`
- Run `examples/demo/demo_cache_functionality.py`

### 3. Manual Verification

- Run a benchmark task and verify that results are cached correctly
- Run a fetcher task and verify that results are cached correctly
- Check that cache directories are created in the expected locations:
  - `.api_cache/llm/` for LLM cache files
  - `.api_cache/clinical_trials/` for clinical trials cache files
- Verify that cache statistics are reported correctly

## Expected Behavior

### Cache Directory Structure

The new caching system organizes cache files by namespace:

```
.api_cache/
  ├── llm/
  │   ├── [LLM cache files]
  │   └── ...
  ├── clinical_trials/
  │   ├── [Clinical trials cache files]
  │   └── ...
  └── test/
      ├── [Test cache files]
      └── ...
```

### Cache Key Generation

Cache keys are now generated deterministically based on:
- Function name
- Arguments
- Namespace

This ensures consistent cache hits for the same inputs.

### Cache Expiration

The new system maintains the same TTL values as the old system:
- LLM cache: 24 hours (86400 seconds)
- Clinical trials search: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
- Clinical trials study details: 24 hours (86400 seconds)

### Cache Statistics

The unified API manager provides statistics for all cache namespaces:
- Number of cached items
- Total size of cached items
- Per-namespace statistics

## Benefits of the New System

1. **Centralized Management**: Single point of control for all API caching
2. **Namespace Separation**: Different cache namespaces prevent data mixing
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Single codebase for caching logic
4. **Better Monitoring**: Unified statistics and monitoring
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new cache namespaces for future components

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered with the new caching system:

1. Revert changes to `src/pipeline/strict_llm_base.py`
2. Revert changes to `src/pipeline/fetcher.py`
3. Restore the original `src/utils/cache_decorator.py` file
4. Revert changes to demo and test files

## Conclusion

The caching system has been successfully refactored to use a unified API manager approach. All components now use the same caching infrastructure, which should improve maintainability and extensibility while maintaining the same functionality as the previous system.
