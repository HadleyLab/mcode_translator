# Clinical Trial Data Fetcher Updates

## Overview
This document outlines the updates made to the Clinical Trial Data Fetcher to fix field validation issues and improve error handling.

## Issues Fixed

### Field Validation Issue
The original implementation had a field validation issue in the `get_full_study` function. The function was using `DEFAULT_SEARCH_FIELDS` which included "EligibilityCriteria", but this field is not valid for the JSON format in the ClinicalTrials API.

### Solution
1. Added a `VALID_JSON_FIELDS` list that contains only the fields that are valid for the JSON format:
   - NCTId
   - BriefTitle
   - Condition
   - OverallStatus
   - BriefSummary
   - StartDate
   - CompletionDate

2. Modified the `get_full_study` function to use `VALID_JSON_FIELDS` instead of `DEFAULT_SEARCH_FIELDS` to avoid field validation errors.

## Code Changes

### fetcher.py
```python
# Fields that are valid for JSON format in ClinicalTrials API
VALID_JSON_FIELDS = [
    "NCTId",
    "BriefTitle",
    "Condition",
    "OverallStatus",
    "BriefSummary",
    "StartDate",
    "CompletionDate"
]

def get_full_study(nct_id: str):
    # ... other code ...
    
    # First try with the NCT ID directly
    try:
        # Use specific fields like in search_trials to avoid issues with fields=None
        api_fields = [FIELD_MAPPING.get(field, field) for field in VALID_JSON_FIELDS]
        result = ct.get_study_fields(
            search_expr=search_expr,
            fields=api_fields,
            max_studies=1,
            fmt="json"
        )
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Exception in get_study_fields for NCT ID {nct_id} with search expression '{search_expr}': {str(e)}")
        result = None
    
    # ... rest of the function ...
    
    # If we get None or empty result, try with quotes around the NCT ID
    if result is None or (isinstance(result, dict) and 'studies' in result and len(result['studies']) == 0):
        search_expr = f'"{nct_id}"'
        logger.info(f"First attempt failed, trying search expression with quotes: {search_expr}")
        try:
            # Use specific fields like in search_trials to avoid issues with fields=None
            api_fields = [FIELD_MAPPING.get(field, field) for field in VALID_JSON_FIELDS]
            result = ct.get_study_fields(
                search_expr=search_expr,
                fields=api_fields,
                max_studies=1,
                fmt="json"
            )
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Exception in get_study_fields for NCT ID {nct_id} with search expression '{search_expr}': {str(e)}")
            result = None
        logger.info(f"Second attempt result type: {type(result)}, value: {result}")
```

## Error Handling Improvements

The `get_full_study` function now has improved error handling with:
1. Better logging of API requests and responses
2. Multiple attempts to fetch study data with different search expression formats
3. More specific error messages for different failure scenarios
4. Proper validation of API responses

## Testing

The changes have been tested and verified to work correctly:
1. Study details are now fetched successfully without field validation errors
2. Row click events work properly without async handling errors
3. The application correctly handles various edge cases and error conditions

## Additional Issues Fixed

### Incomplete Study Data Retrieval
The `get_full_study` function was using `get_study_fields` with specific fields, which limited the data returned and didn't include eligibility criteria.

### Solution
Modified `get_full_study` to use `get_full_studies` method instead, which retrieves complete study data including eligibility criteria.

## Updated Code Changes

### fetcher.py
```python
# Updated FIELD_MAPPING to remove invalid fields
FIELD_MAPPING = {
    "NCTId": "NCTId",
    "BriefTitle": "BriefTitle",
    "Condition": "Condition",
    "OverallStatus": "OverallStatus",
    "BriefSummary": "BriefSummary",
    "StartDate": "StartDate",
    "CompletionDate": "CompletionDate"
}

# Updated DEFAULT_SEARCH_FIELDS to remove invalid fields
DEFAULT_SEARCH_FIELDS = [
    "NCTId",
    "BriefTitle",
    "Condition",
    "OverallStatus",
    "BriefSummary",
    "StartDate",
    "CompletionDate"
]

def get_full_study(nct_id: str):
    # ... other code ...
    
    # First try with the NCT ID directly
    try:
        # Use get_full_studies instead of get_study_fields to get complete data
        result = ct.get_full_studies(
            search_expr=search_expr,
            max_studies=1,
            fmt="json"
        )
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Exception in get_full_studies for NCT ID {nct_id} with search expression '{search_expr}': {str(e)}")
        result = None
    
    # ... rest of the function ...
    
    # If we get None or empty result, try with quotes around the NCT ID
    if result is None or (isinstance(result, dict) and 'studies' in result and len(result['studies']) == 0):
        search_expr = f'"{nct_id}"'
        logger.info(f"First attempt failed, trying search expression with quotes: {search_expr}")
        try:
            # Use get_full_studies instead of get_study_fields to get complete data
            result = ct.get_full_studies(
                search_expr=search_expr,
                max_studies=1,
                fmt="json"
            )
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Exception in get_full_studies for NCT ID {nct_id} with search expression '{search_expr}': {str(e)}")
            result = None
        logger.info(f"Second attempt result type: {type(result)}, value: {result}")
```

## Enhanced Testing

The changes have been tested and verified to work correctly:

### Unit Tests
- Added tests for `get_full_study` with eligibility criteria
- Added tests for the quotes fallback mechanism
- Added tests to verify field constants are valid

### Integration Tests
- Added integration tests to verify the actual API functionality
- Tests verify that eligibility criteria are properly retrieved
- Tests verify proper error handling for non-existent studies

### Component Tests
- Added specific tests for eligibility criteria structure and content
- Tests verify that eligibility criteria are properly formatted
- Tests verify that eligibility criteria contain expected content

## Enhanced Impact

These changes have resolved the field validation errors that were preventing the application from fetching detailed study information. The application now works correctly and users can search for clinical trials and view detailed study information including eligibility criteria without encountering the previous errors.

The eligibility criteria for NCT03929822 now include:

Inclusion Criteria:
- Women called back from a screening mammography by either FFDM or tomosynthesis with soft tissue abnormalities including masses, asymmetries, focal asymmetries or architectural distortion with or without calcifications.

Exclusion Criteria:
- Age <30 years old
- Screening mammography with only calcifications abnormalities
- Male patients
- Pregnant or lactating patients
- Patients with any allergy to iodinated contrast
