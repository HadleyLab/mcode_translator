# mCODE Translator System - Comprehensive Summary

## Project Overview
The mCODE Translator is a sophisticated system designed to process clinical trial eligibility criteria from clinicaltrials.gov and translate them into standardized mCODE (Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements) format. This system bridges the gap between unstructured clinical trial criteria and structured, interoperable oncology data.

## System Architecture

**Default NLP Engine**: LLM (deepseek-coder) with fallback to Regex/SpaCy

   - Extracts eligibility criteria text from records

2. **NLP Engine**
   - **Primary Engine**: LLM (deepseek-coder) for highest accuracy
   - **Fallback Engines**:
     - Regex for fast pattern matching
     - SpaCy with medical models
   - Specialized for breast cancer biomarker extraction (ER/PR/HER2)
   - Processes unstructured text using medical NLP techniques
   - Identifies medical conditions, treatments, procedures
   - Extracts demographic restrictions and lab values
   - Uses medical terminology dictionaries
   - Includes fallback mechanisms for robust operation

4. **mCODE Mapper**
   - Comprehensive mapping to mCODE FHIR standards
   - Specialized breast cancer support:
     - Biomarker mapping (ER/PR/HER2 status)
     - Genomic variants (BRCA1/2, PIK3CA, TP53)
     - Treatment history (chemo, radiation, surgery)
   - Code system support:
     - ICD-10-CM, CPT, LOINC, RxNorm, SNOMED CT
     - Cross-walks between systems (ICD10CM â†” SNOMEDCT)
   - Advanced features:
     - mCODE compliance validation
     - Demographic mapping (age, gender, race/ethnicity)
     - Structured FHIR resource generation
     - Confidence scoring for mappings

5. **Structured Data Generator**
   - Creates structured mCODE representations
   - Ensures data completeness and consistency
   - Handles relationships between data elements
   - Applies default values where appropriate

6. **Output Formatter**
   - Formats output in various standards (JSON, XML, FHIR)
   - Validates generated mCODE data
   - Provides error reporting and data quality metrics
   - Supports batch processing capabilities
