The secondary and exploratory objectives include duration of response, overall survival, and progression-free survival.\n\nThe study will enroll approximately 90 patients at up to 20 centers in the United States.\n\nThe first two galinpepimut-S injections will initially be administered as monotherapy every three weeks (Week 0 and Week 3). Thereafter, galinpepimut-S will be co-administered with pembrolizumab every three weeks for four additional administrations (for the galinpepimut-S initial immunization induction phase series; weeks 6-15) to coincide with the per label pembrolizumab dosing frequency. After that, there will be one un-paired administration of pembrolizumab (week 18), and then galinpepimut-S will be resumed Q3W for six additional doses (early immune booster phase; weeks 21-36).\n\nAt the end of this phase, there will be a 12-week interval where three unpaired administrations of pembrolizumab will occur (weeks 39-45), and then galinpepimut-S will be resumed on an every 12-week schedule for four additional doses (late immune booster phase; weeks 48-84). After 84 weeks, continuing non-progressed patients will be treated with pembrolizumab alone up until week 111.\n\nPembrolizumab will be administered at a dose of 200 mg intravenously Q3W on Day 1 of each cycle (three week cycles) starting on Study Week 6 and continuing for up to two years thereafter (Study Week 111).

Over the past decade, the incidence of women diagnosed with early-stage TNBC has significantly increased due to the widespread use of screening mammography. Treatment of patients with localized TNBC mainly involves surgery and (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. However, the benefit of chemotherapy may be controversial in patients with early-stage TNBC defined by small size and absence of lymph node involvement, and with significant tumor lymphocyte infiltration.\n\nThe ETNA study is a phase II trial designed to evaluate a chemotherapy de-escalation strategy in patients with TNBC T1b/c N0M0 and stromal TILs (sTILs) ≥ 30%. ETNA comprises two cohorts defined according to the level of TILs and the age of patients. Patients aged \\> 40 years with 30% ≤ sTILs \\< 50% and those aged ≤ 40 years with 30% ≤ sTILs \\< 75% will be included in the cohort 1 and will receive adjuvant pembrolizumab 200 mg every three weeks for 9 cycles and Paclitaxel 80 mg/m² weekly for 12 cycles. Patients aged \\> 40 years with sTILs ≥ 50% and those aged ≤ 40 years with sTILs ≥ 75% will be included in cohort 2 and will not receive adjuvant treatment, they will undergo standard surveillance every six months.", "detailedDescription": "(Neo)adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer is associated to long-term persistent QoL deterioration in patients with early breast cancer, with a greater negative impact in patients that were premenopausal at diagnosis. Because triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which accounts for 10-20% of breast cancers, presents a poorer prognosis as compared to the other subtypes, international guidelines endorse the use of adjuvant chemotherapy from TNBC tumors measuring \\> 5 mm. Nevertheless, a number of retrospective studies have reported excellent prognosis for patients with small, lymph node-negative and high TILs TNBC, even without chemotherapy, with 5-year overall survival (OS) of 98%. Findings from multiple data sets consistently demonstrated that TILs represent a robust prognostic and predictive biomarker in early-stage TNBC, being now the first biological prognostic marker for TNBC included in several international guidelines for early-stage disease, such as 2019 St Gallen consensus conference and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Guidelines for early-stage breast cancer.\n\nIn clinical practice, oncologists have taken different approaches in patients with stage I TNBC. While some have de-escalated anthracyclines, other did not held back on the standard chemotherapy options with anthracyclines, taxanes, and cyclophosphamide. Based on unpublished data from the TNBC pooled analysis with sTILs on 2211 patients not treated by systematic therapy, performed at Gustave Roussy, the 5-year distant disease free-survival (DDFS) is 87%, 91%, and 93% for those with stage I and sTILs ≥ 30%, 50%, and 75%, respectively. Given these compelling findings from historical observations, it is reasonable to anticipate that the absolute benefit of chemotherapy would be modest among these patients as their tumors generally exhibit a favorable prognosis, resulting in reduced benefits with the use of adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nETNA is a phase II, multicenter, biomarker-driven study that is designed to characterize the clinical course of patients with stage I TNBC and sTILs ≥ 30%.\n\nETNA includes patients with stage I and sTILs ≥ 30% TNBC in 2 cohorts:\n\n* Cohort 1 will include patients age \\> 40 years with 30% ≤ sTILs \\< 50% and those aged ≤ 40 years with 30% ≤ sTILs \\< 75%. Patients will receive 9 cycles of adjuvant pembrolizumab 200 mg every three weeks for 9 cycles and Paclitaxel 80 mg/m² weekly for 12 cycles.\n* Cohort 2 will include patients aged \\> 40 years with sTILs ≥ 50% and those aged ≤ 40 years with sTILs ≥ 75% who will undergo standard surveillance (no adjuvant systemic treatments)."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Triple-negative Breast Cancer"], "keywords": ["Breast cancer", "De-escalation", "Immunotherapy", "Chemotherapy"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE2"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NON_RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "PARALLEL", "interventionModelDescription": "Cohort of patients with T1b/c N0 M0 TNBC aged \\> 40 years with 30% ≤ sTILs \\< 50% and those aged ≤ 40 years with 30% ≤ sTILs \\< 75%: Pembrolizumab will be administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W), with a total of 9 cycles and Paclitaxel 80 mg/m² weekly for 12 cycles at adjuvant phase of the treatment; Cohort of patients with T1b/c N0 M0 TNBC aged \\> 40 years and sTILs ≥ 50% and those aged ≤ 40 years with sTILs ≥ 75%: No treatment will be administered.
