A second dose of contrast equal to the first dose will be given, and additional images will be obtained in the supine position. Subtraction images will be generated for both the prone and the supine sequences.

It is expected that the addition of a second injection of contrast will improve the ability to visualize and accurately segment the supine post-Gd images.

Laboratory-treated T cells may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Vaccines made from HER2 peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells that express HER2. Giving laboratory-treated T cells and cyclophosphamide after vaccine therapy may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of ex vivo-expanded HER2-specific T cells when given together with cyclophosphamide after vaccine therapy in treating patients with HER2-positive stage IV breast cancer.", "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the feasibility of expanding HER-2-specific effector T cells (TE) ex vivo from CD62L+ TCM and CD62L- TEM from patients immunized with a HER-2 peptide vaccine.\n\nII. To evaluate the safety of infusing autologous ex vivo expanded HER-2-specific T cells into patients with advanced HER-2+ breast cancer.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the persistence, function, and phenotype of adoptively transferred HER-2-specific TE cells derived from TCM or TEM precursors.\n\nII. To investigate the potential anti-tumor effects of therapy with ex vivo expanded HER-2-specific T cells in patients with advanced HER-2+ breast cancer.\n\nOUTLINE : This is a dose-escalation study of ex vivo-expanded HER2-specific T cells.\n\nVACCINE THERAPY: Patients receive HER2 peptide vaccine intradermally once weekly for 3 weeks.\n\nCHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on day -1.\n\nIMMUNOTHERAPY: Patients receive ex vivo-expanded HER2 specific T-cell IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 10, and 20.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on days 28, 35, 49, 63 and then monthly thereafter for 1 year."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["HER2-positive Breast Cancer", "Male Breast Cancer", "Stage IV Breast Cancer"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "INTERVENTIONAL", "phases": ["PHASE1"], "designInfo": {"allocation": "NON_RANDOMIZED", "interventionModel": "SINGLE_GROUP", "primaryPurpose": "TREATMENT", "maskingInfo": {"masking": "NONE"}}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 0, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "Arm I", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "VACCINE THERAPY: Patients receive HER2 peptide vaccine intradermally once weekly for 3 weeks.\n\nCHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on day -1.\n\nIMMUNOTHERAPY: Patients receive ex vivo-expanded HER2 specific T-cell IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 10, and 20.", "interventionNames": ["Biological: HER-2/neu peptide vaccine", "Drug: cyclophosphamide", "Biological: ex vivo-expanded HER2-specific T cells", "Other: laboratory biomarker analysis", "Other: flow cytometry", "Other: immunoenzyme technique"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "BIOLOGICAL", "name": "HER-2/neu peptide vaccine", "description": "Given intradermally", "armGroupLabels": ["Arm I"], "otherNames": ["HER-2"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "cyclophosphamide", "description": "Given IV", "armGroupLabels": ["Arm I"], "otherNames": ["CPM", "CTX", "Cytoxan", "Endoxan", "Endoxana", "Enduxan"]}, {"type": "BIOLOGICAL", "name": "ex vivo-expanded HER2-specific T cells", "description": "Given IV", "armGroupLabels": ["Arm I"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "laboratory biomarker analysis", "description": "Correlative studies", "armGroupLabels": ["Arm I"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "flow cytometry", "description": "Correlative studies", "armGroupLabels": ["Arm I"]}, {"type": "OTHER", "name": "immunoenzyme technique", "description": "Correlative studies", "armGroupLabels": ["Arm I"], "otherNames": ["immunoenzyme techniques"]}]}, "outcomesModule": {"primaryOutcomes": [{"measure": "Ability to expand HER-2-specific T cells ex vivo from memory T cell subsets which are derived from patients with advanced HER-2 expressing cancer", "description": "Ability to expand HER-2-specific T cells ex vivo from memory T cell subsets which are derived from patients with advanced HER-2 expressing cancer will be defined as feasible if the minimum target expansion of HER-2-specific T cells is achieved in ≥2/3 expansions in ≥7/10 subjects.", "timeFrame": "After leukapheresis (2 weeks after 3rd vaccination) and prior to chemotherapy"}, {"measure": "Safety and systemic toxicity as assessed at regular time points by NCI common toxicity criteria (CTCAE v 4.0).

DCE MRI uses a new way of collecting and analyzing the images or pictures which provides doctors extra information not available with standard imaging methods. This includes information about the blood vessels of different breast diseases. Pictures produced this way look just like the regular MRI pictures. The DCE MRI adds another imaging sequence (another scan) to the MRI examination ordered by your physician to evaluate your breast lesion, thus increasing the exam time (extra 10 min). The information gained from doing the new test, the DCE MRI, will not be used in your treatment and will not affect the type of care you receive for your breast lesions.", "detailedDescription": "Our aim is to perform dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI on 150 patients during their routine breast MRI examination at MSKCC. This will add extra 10 min scanning time to the routine examination. High resolution (submillimeter) parametric maps of pathophysiologic quantities, such as tumor vessel permeability, tumor perfusion, extracellular extravascular volume fraction, will be generated from the DCE MRI data. These results will be correlated with pathology to determine new pharmacokinetic threshold so that the negative predictive value for benign lesions is close to 100%. The improvement in diagnostic specificity may help to reduce unnecessary biopsies in the future."}, "conditionsModule": {"conditions": ["Breast Cancer"], "keywords": ["Breast Lesion", "Lesion", "Breast", "Cancer", "05-091"]}, "designModule": {"studyType": "OBSERVATIONAL", "designInfo": {"observationalModel": "CASE_ONLY", "timePerspective": "PROSPECTIVE"}, "enrollmentInfo": {"count": 116, "type": "ACTUAL"}}, "armsInterventionsModule": {"armGroups": [{"label": "1", "description": "Any patient undergoing MRI guided preoperative needle localization or MRI guided biopsy of the breast.", "interventionNames": ["Other: perform dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "OTHER", "name": "perform dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI", "description": "With an IV catheter in place, the patient will lie prone on the MRI scanner table with the breasts positioned in the commercial breast coil and then be moved feet first to the center of the MRI scanner.

The contrast injection and saline flush will be delivered by the injector while the patient is inside the scanner and the DCE MRI data collection is in process.
